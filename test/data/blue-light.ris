AB  - BACKGROUND: Antirrhinum majus contains aurone with excellent antibacterial and antifungal activities. In addition, visible light activates the endogenous porphyrins of Propionibacterium acne, which results in bacterial death. Therefore, considering the above-mentioned facts, the aim of the present study was to prepare a topical herbal gel of A. majus hydroalcoholic extract and to evaluate its antiacne effects with or without blue light combination as an activator of the porphyrins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activity of the shoot or petal extracts was evaluated by disc diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was calculated. Various gel formulations were developed by the Experimental Design software. The obtained gel formulations were prepared and tested for pharmaceutical parameters including organoleptic features, pH, viscosity, drug content, and release studies. Finally, the antibacterial activity was evaluated against (P. acnes) with or without blue light. RESULTS: The MIC of the extracts showed to be 0.25 μg/ml. Evaluation of the gel formulation showed acceptable properties of the best formulation in comparison to a gel in the market. Pharmaceutical parameters were also in accordance with the standard parameters of the marketed gel. Furthermore, statistical analyses showed significant antibacterial effect for gel when compared to negative control. However, combination of blue light with gel did not show any significant difference on the observed antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Because of the statistically significant in vitro antiacne effects of the formulated gel, further clinical studies for evaluation of the healing effects of the prepared gel formulation on acne lesions must be performed.

AB  - Acne vulgaris is a common dermatosis affecting 80% of the population. To date, different treatments have been used to manage this condition. Antibacterials and retinoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for acne, but their success rate varies. Phototherapy is emerging as an alternative option to treat acne vulgaris. Studies examining the role of different wavelengths and methods of light treatment have shown that phototherapy with visible light, specifically blue light, has a marked effect on inflammatory acne lesions and seems sufficient for the treatment of acne. In addition, the combination of blue-red light radiation seems to be superior to blue light alone, with minimal adverse effects. Photodynamic therapy has also been used, even in nodular and cystic acne, and had excellent therapeutic outcomes, although with significant adverse effects. Recently, low energy pulsed dye laser therapy has been used, and seems to be a promising alternative that would allow the simultaneous treatment of active acne and acne scarring. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of phototherapy as a monotherapy or an adjuvant treatment in the current management of acne vulgaris.

AB  - Acne pathogenesis is a multifactorial process that occurs at the level of the pilosebaceous unit. While acne was previously perceived as an infectious disease, recent data have clarified it as an inflammatory process in which Propionibacterium acnes and innate immunity play critical roles in propagating abnormal hyperkeratinization and inflammation. Alterations in sebum composition, and increased sensitivity to androgens, also play roles in the inflammatory process. A stepwise approach to acne management utilizes topical agents for mild to moderate acne (topical retinoid as mainstay ± topical antibiotics) and escalation to oral agents for more resistant cases (oral antibiotics or hormonal agents in conjunction with a topical retinoid or oral isotretinoin alone for severe acne). Concerns over antibiotic resistance and the safety issues associated with isotretinoin have prompted further research into alternative medications and devices for the treatment of acne. Radiofrequency, laser, and light treatments have demonstrated modest improvement for inflammatory acne (with blue-light photodynamic therapy being the only US FDA-approved treatment). However, limitations in study design and patient follow-up render these modalities as adjuncts rather than standalone options. This review will update readers on the latest advancements in our understanding of acne pathogenesis and treatment, with emphasis on emerging treatment options that can help improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Photodynamic therapy is a non-invasive technique used in the treatment of skin diseases which has various advantages, one being the ability to localize treatment to the area being treated, which is common among most photosensitizers. Aminolevulinic acid is a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly to form the photosensitizing molecule protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). When PpIX is activated by light, cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and free radicals are generated. This phototoxic effect may cause malignant and non-malignant hyperproliferative tissue to be destroyed, to decrease in size, and to eventually disappear. The application of topical aminolevulinic acid 20% followed by the use of a blue light photodynamic therapy illuminator is indicated in the US for the treatment of non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses of the face or scalp. There are data suggesting that aminolevulinic acid/photodynamic therapy may also be beneficial in acne vulgaris, verrucae, psoriasis, mycosis fungoides, and human papillomavirus. This treatment modality has also proven effective in the management of skin cancer such as, Bowen disease and basal cell carcinoma. Further experience in the use of photodynamic therapy will help define its utility in the management of actinic keratosis and other dermatoses.

AB  - Acne vulgaris is a disease of the pilosebaceous unit and the most common inflammatory dermatosis worldwide. It is also associated with significant economic burden. Limitations of conventional topical and systemic treatments include long treatment course, intolerable adverse effects, antibiotic resistance, and patient compliance. Therefore, laser and light-based interventions present as alternative options over the past decade and have been used in combination with conventional pharmacological therapies and other physical modalities. An updated overview on the use of lasers and light-based devices in acne management is presented to help clinicians understand the safety and efficacy of these treatment options. The effectiveness of neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) for treating acne is supported by more high-level studies compared with other laser devices. There is limited evidence to support the use of CO(2) lasers, potassium titanyl phosphate lasers, and 1565-nm non-ablative fractional lasers for treating acne. Among light devices, photodynamic therapy is the most studied, showing higher efficacies than some of the conventional topical and oral acne therapies. Intense-pulsed light and blue light therapies also show favorable outcomes. A limitation is that most studies are non-randomized and lack a control group, and report on a variety of device settings, treatment regimens, and outcome measures, making it challenging to summarize and generalize findings. Although the use of laser and light devices to treat acne is promising, further work with randomized controlled study designs and larger sample sizes will provide improved guidance on the application of these modalities.

AB  - PURPOSE: Antibiotic use in acne treatment raises concerns about increased resistance, necessitating alternatives. We assessed the effectiveness of blue-light therapy for acne. METHODS: We analyzed randomized controlled trials comparing blue light with nonlight interventions. Studies included people of any age, sex, and acne severity, in any setting, and reported on investigator-assessed change in acne severity, patients' assessment of improvement, change in inflammatory or noninflammatory lesions, and adverse events. Where data were sufficient, mean differences were calculated. RESULTS: Eighteen references (14 trials) including 698 participants were included. Most of the trials were small and short (<12 weeks) and had high risk of bias. Investigator-assessed improvement was quantitatively reported in 5 trials, of which 3 reported significantly greater improvement in blue light than comparator, and 2 reported improvement. Patients' assessments of improvement were quantitatively reported by 2 trials, favoring blue light. Mean difference in the mean number of noninflammatory lesions was nonsignificant between groups at weeks 4, 8, and 10-12 and overall (mean difference [MD] = 3.47; 95% CI, -0.76 to 7.71; P = 0.11). Mean difference in the mean number of inflammatory lesions was likewise nonsignificant between groups at any of the time points and overall (MD = 0.16; 95% CI, -0.99 to 1.31; P = 0.78). Adverse events were generally mild and favored blue light or did not significantly differ between groups. CONCLUSION: Methodological and reporting limitations of existing evidence limit conclusions about the effectiveness of blue light for acne. Clinicians and patients should therefore consider the balance between its benefits and adverse events, as well as costs.

AB  - Light-emitting diodes (LED) have been used to treat acne vulgaris. However, the efficacy of LED on sebaceous lipid production in vitro has not been examined. This study investigated the efficacy of 415 nm blue light and 630 nm red light on lipid production in human sebocytes. When applied to human primary sebocytes, 415 nm blue light suppressed cell proliferation. Based on a lipogenesis study using Oil Red O, Nile red staining, and thin-layered chromatography, 630 nm red light strongly downregulated lipid production in sebocytes. These results suggest that 415 nm blue light and 630 nm red light influence lipid production in human sebocytes and have beneficial effects on acne by suppressing sebum production.

AB  - Acne is one of the common dermatological skin inflammatory conditions. The current therapeutic modalities for the treatment of acne include the administration of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents. The rising instance of antibiotic resistance in acne strains has led to the exploration of alternative therapeutic modalities. In the current study, we have employed a liposomal gold nanoparticle entrapping curcumin (Au Lipos Cur NPs) for dual light-mediated therapy for the treatment of acne. These nanoparticles exerted a positive zeta potential that enabled their localized follicular delivery by iontophoresis. The localized deposition of Au Lipos NPs leads to photothermal transduction causing destruction of sebaceous glands. Furthermore, when the nanoparticles were assessed in vitro by sequential irradiation with NIR and blue light, it resulted in significant inhibition of bacterial growth. Thus the dual light-mediated therapy by Au Lipos Cur NPs can form a potential therapeutic modality for the efficient treatment of recurrent acne.

AB  - We undertook a Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of light-based interventions for acne vulgaris. We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, ISI Web of Science and grey literature sources (September 2015). We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group approach to assess the quality of evidence (QoE). We included 71 RCTs (4211 participants, median sample size 31). Results from a single study (n = 266, low QoE) showed little or no difference in effectiveness on participants' assessment of improvement between 20% aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) photodynamic therapy (PDT), activated by blue light, vs. vehicle plus blue light, whereas another study (n = 180) comparing ALA-PDT (red light) concentrations showed that 20% ALA-PDT was no more effective than 15% ALA-PDT but better than 10% and 5% ALA-PDT. Pooled data from three studies (n = 360, moderate QoE) showed that methyl aminolaevulinate PDT, activated by red light, had a similar effect on changes in lesion counts vs. placebo cream with red light. Several studies compared yellow light with placebo or no treatment, infrared light with no treatment, gold microparticle suspension with vehicle and clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide (C/BPO) combined with pulsed dye laser with C/BPO alone. None of these showed any clinically significant effects. Most studies reported adverse effects, but inadequately, with scarring reported as absent, and blistering only in studies on intense pulsed light, infrared light and PDT (very low QoE). Carefully planned studies, using standardized outcome measures and common acne treatments as comparators, are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne is common and can lead to scarring of the skin, as well as to psychological distress and reduced self-esteem. Most topical or oral treatments for acne are inconvenient and have side-effects. Laser and other light therapies have been reported to be convenient, safe and effective in treating acne. OBJECTIVES: To carry out a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of light and laser therapies for acne vulgaris. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, LILACS, ISI Science Citation Index and Dissertation Abstracts International for relevant published trials. RESULTS: We identified 25 trials (694 patients), 13 of light therapy and 12 of light therapy plus light-activated topical cream (photodynamic therapy, PDT). Overall, the results from trials of light alone were disappointing, but the trials of blue light, blue-red light and infrared radiation were more successful, particularly those using multiple treatments. Red-blue light was more effective than topical 5% benzoyl peroxide cream in the short term. Most trials of PDT showed some benefit, which was greater with multiple treatments, and better for noninflammatory acne lesions. However, the improvements in inflammatory acne lesions were not better than with topical 1% adapalene gel, and the side-effects of therapy were unacceptable to many participants. CONCLUSIONS: Some forms of light therapy were of short-term benefit. Patients may find it easier to comply with these treatments, despite the initial discomfort, because of their short duration. However, very few trials compared light therapy with conventional acne treatments, were conducted in patients with severe acne or examined long-term benefits of treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blue and red light have been reported to have beneficial effects on acne. However, there has been no double-blind, randomized study of acne treatment for combined blue and red light-emitting diode (LED) devices, and the associated molecular mechanisms have rarely been investigated. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, safety and histological changes of combined blue and red LED phototherapy for acne vulgaris. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with mild-to-moderate acne were randomly assigned to either a home-use irradiation group using an LED device, or a control group using a sham device. The treatment group was instructed to serially irradiate their forehead and cheeks with 420-nm blue light and 660-nm red light for 2.5 min twice daily for 4 weeks. RESULTS: At the final visit at 12 weeks, both inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions had decreased significantly, by 77% and 54%, respectively, in the treatment group. No significant difference was observed in the control group. In the treatment group, sebum output reduction, attenuated inflammatory cell infiltrations and a decreased size of the sebaceous gland were found. The immunostaining intensities for interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1α, matrix metalloproteinase-9, toll-like receptor-2, nuclear factor-κB, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and sterol response element binding protein (SREBP)-1 were reduced concomitantly. Messenger RNA expression of SREBP-1c was also decreased. No severe adverse reactions were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This LED phototherapy was safe and effective for treating not only inflammatory but also noninflammatory acne lesions, with good compliance. The experimental results correlated well with clinical results, partly elucidating the related molecular mechanisms.

AB  - In this study we have evaluated the use of blue light (peak at 415 nm) and a mixed blue and red light (peaks at 415 and 660 nm) in the treatment of acne vulgaris. One hundred and seven patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris were randomized into four treatment groups: blue light, mixed blue and red light, cool white light and 5% benzoyl peroxide cream. Subjects in the phototherapy groups used portable light sources and irradiation was carried out daily for 15 min. Comparative assessment between the three light sources was made in an observer-blinded fashion, but this could not be achieved for the use of benzoyl peroxide. Assessments were performed every 4 weeks. After 12 weeks of active treatment a mean improvement of 76% (95% confidence interval 66-87) in inflammatory lesions was achieved by the combined blue-red light phototherapy; this was significantly superior to that achieved by blue light (at weeks 4 and 8 but not week 12), benzoyl peroxide (at weeks 8 and 12) or white light (at each assessment). The final mean improvement in comedones by using blue-red light was 58% (95% confidence interval 45-71), again better than that achieved by the other active treatments used, although the differences did not reach significant levels. We have found that phototherapy with mixed blue-red light, probably by combining antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action, is an effective means of treating acne vulgaris of mild to moderate severity, with no significant short-term adverse effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many acne patients improve after exposure to sunlight and there are many reports about the efficacy of blue light phototherapy on acne lesions. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of blue light treatment versus topical benzoyl peroxide 5% formulation in patients with acne grades II and III. METHODS: Sixty volunteers with facial acne were included and evaluated in 5 visits: the first one for screening, another 3 held on days 7, 14 and 28 of treatment, and the last one after 14 days of the end of treatment. Thirty of them were irradiated with Blue Light (8 times, twice a week) and the other thirty were treated with topical Benzoyl Peroxide 5% formulation, auto-applied twice a day, every day. We assessed the severity of acne by counting the lesions and analyzing the photographs. RESULTS: The improvement achieved by the blue light was the same as the one with benzoyl peroxide, regardless of the type of lesion (p 0.05). Otherwise, the side effects were less frequent in the group treated with blue light. CONCLUSIONS: Blue light irradiation was as effective as benzoyl peroxide in acne treatment grades II and III but there were fewer side effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-invasive photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has been used as an alternative acne treatment for many years. Riboflavin and tryptophan are newly introduced photosensitizers. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of PDT with riboflavin-tryptophan (RT) gel with that of 13% ALA for the treatment of facial acne. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, split-face study of 37 subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris. RT gel was applied to half of the face, and 13% ALA was applied to the other half. Then, the whole face was irradiated using a blue light-emitting diode for 20 mins. Four treatment sessions were performed over a 4-week duration, at 1-week interval. The acne lesion counts and acne severity were assessed. Sebum secretion, Propionibacterium acne colonization, pore size, and skin texture were also evaluated. RESULTS: PDT with RT gel demonstrated good efficacy, non-inferior to ALA for acne treatment, with a significant reduction in acne lesion counts, severity grading, porphyrin, and sebum output. The pore size and skin texture were improved. Side-effects were minimal and well tolerated in all subjects. CONCLUSION: PDT therapy with RT gel is an effective alternative treatment for acne vulgaris.

AB  - The treatment of acne and acne scarring with lasers and light-based and energy-based technologies has become an integral component of our therapeutic arsenal. Lasers including infrared wavelengths and pulsed dye lasers; light devices including blue light, red light, and broadband light; and photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid and methylaminolevulinic acid have been shown to be effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris. The optimal outcomes are achieved with photodynamic therapy combined with medical therapy. Acne scarring has been best treated with lasers, including nonablative infrared lasers, fractional nonablative and ablative laser resurfacing, and most recently needle-based radiofrequency devices.

AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has evolved since its inception at the beginning of the 20th century, when it was defined as an oxygen-dependent reaction between a photosensitizing dye and light. Photosensitizers and light sources have since been continually optimized for distinct applications and tissues. Systemic porphyrins, such as hematoporphyrin, were the first photosensitizers to be used, mostly to treat tumors. The first light sources used were broad-band, noncoherent lights, such as quartz, xenon, tungsten, or halogen lamps. The wavelengths of light chosen were based upon the absorption spectrum of porphyrins: blue because the largest peak is at 400 nm (the Soret band) and red because of its greater penetration depth but lesser absorption at 650 nm (a Q band). Systemic photosensitizers caused prolonged photosensitivity, and broad-band light sources had limitations and side effects. The development of topical photosensitizers, such as 5-aminolevulinic acid, and the advent of lasers in recent years have advanced PDT for cutaneous use. In the 1990s, red lasers were applied to PDT because of their increased skin penetration despite lesser absorption by porphyrins. Broad-band blue light and red light have been studied extensively, the former achieving Food and Drug Administration approval in combination with topical aminolevulinic acid for the treatment of actinic keratosis in 1997. These lasers and light sources caused significant side effects, such as discomfort, erythema, crusting, blistering, and dyspigmentation. The recent application of the long-pulsed pulsed dye laser (595 nm) after topical aminolevulinic acid greatly minimized side effects without compromising efficacy. Long-pulsed pulsed dye laser-mediated PDT has since been shown to be effective in treatment of actinic keratosis, actinic cheilitis, sebaceous hyperplasia, lichen sclerosus, and, most recently, acne vulgaris. Finally, intense pulsed light sources have been introduced to PDT for the treatment of photodamage and acne, offering advantages of versatility in wavelengths and applications.

AB  - Patients with acne are increasingly using sunbeds as a self treatment despite the harmful effects. Little is known about sunbed use in adult patients with acne under dermatology care. This questionnaire study explored prevalence and behaviours surrounding sunbed use in patients with acne at a UK dermatology centre. Over a quarter (26%) of respondents used sunbeds and of these, 72% used them at least weekly. Respondents using sunbeds were more likely to be older, to be female, to have a longer duration of acne diagnosis and to have previously been offered blue-light therapy by their doctor (P < 0.05 for all) Reasons for use included recommendations from external sources (including the Internet), the perceived greater efficacy compared with physician-prescribed treatments and that light therapy was not offered by their doctor. Nearly half (49%) of respondents were taking isotretinoin at the time of sunbed use, which carries an increased risk for photosensitivity and sunburn in this cohort. Dermatologists have a responsibility to address this gap in public awareness by directly counselling patients at risk of sunbed use, particularly for those concomitantly prescribed oral retinoid therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a very common skin problem that presents with blackheads, whiteheads, and inflamed spots. It frequently results in physical scarring and may cause psychological distress. The use of oral and topical treatments can be limited in some people due to ineffectiveness, inconvenience, poor tolerability or side-effects. Some studies have suggested promising results for light therapies. OBJECTIVES: To explore the effects of light treatment of different wavelengths for acne. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to September 2015: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We searched ISI Web of Science and Dissertation Abstracts International (from inception). We also searched five trials registers, and grey literature sources. We checked the reference lists of studies and reviews and consulted study authors and other experts in the field to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We updated these searches in July 2016 but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs of light for treatment of acne vulgaris, regardless of language or publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 71 studies, randomising a total of 4211 participants.Most studies were small (median 31 participants) and included participants with mild to moderate acne of both sexes and with a mean age of 20 to 30 years. Light interventions differed greatly in wavelength, dose, active substances used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), and comparator interventions (most commonly no treatment, placebo, another light intervention, or various topical treatments). Numbers of light sessions varied from one to 112 (most commonly two to four). Frequency of application varied from twice daily to once monthly.Selection and performance bias were unclear in the majority of studies. Detection bias was unclear for participant-assessed outcomes and low for investigator-assessed outcomes in the majority of studies. Attrition and reporting bias were low in over half of the studies and unclear or high in the rest. Two thirds of studies were industry-sponsored; study authors either reported conflict of interest, or such information was not declared, so we judged the risk of bias as unclear.Comparisons of most interventions for our first primary outcome 'Participant's global assessment of improvement' were not possible due to the variation in the interventions and the way the studies' outcomes were measured. We did not combine the effect estimates but rated the quality of the evidence as very low for the comparison of light therapies, including PDT to placebo, no treatment, topical treatment or other comparators for this outcome. One study which included 266 participants with moderate to severe acne showed little or no difference in effectiveness for this outcome between 20% aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT (activated by blue light) versus vehicle plus blue light (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.04, low-quality evidence). A study (n = 180) of a comparison of ALA-PDT (activated by red light) concentrations showed 20% ALA was no more effective than 15% (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15) but better than 10% ALA (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.42) and 5% ALA (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.81). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 6 (95% CI 3 to 19) and 4 (95% CI 2 to 6) for the comparison of 20% ALA with 10% and 5% ALA, respectively.For our second primary outcome 'Investigator-assessed changes in lesion counts', we combined three RCTs, with 360 participants with moderate to severe acne and found methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) PDT (activated by red light) was no different to placebo cream plus red light with regard to change in inflamed lesions (ILs) (mean difference (MD) -2.85, 95% CI -7.51 to 1.81), percentage change in ILs (MD -10.09, 95% CI -20.25 to 0.06), change in non-inflamed lesions (NILs) (MD -2.01, 95% CI -7.07 to 3.05), or in percentage change in NILs (MD -8.09, 95% CI -21.51 to 5.32). We assessed the evidence as moderate quality for these outcomes meaning that there is little or no clinical difference between these two interventions for lesion counts.Studies comparing the effects of other interventions were inconsistent or had small samples and high risk of bias. We performed only narrative synthesis for the results of the remaining trials, due to great variation in many aspects of the studies, poor reporting, and failure to obtain necessary data. Several studies compared yellow light to placebo or no treatment, infrared light to no treatment, gold microparticle suspension to vehicle, and clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide combined with pulsed dye laser to clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide alone. There were also several other studies comparing MAL-PDT to light-only treatment, to adapalene and in combination with long-pulsed dye laser to long-pulsed dye laser alone. None of these showed any clinically significant effects.Our third primary outcome was 'Investigator-assessed severe adverse effects'. Most studies reported adverse effects, but not adequately with scarring reported as absent, and blistering reported only in studies on intense pulsed light, infrared light and photodynamic therapies. We rated the quality of the evidence as very low, meaning we were uncertain of the adverse effects of the light therapies.Although our primary endpoint was long-term outcomes, less than half of the studies performed assessments later than eight weeks after final treatment. Only a few studies assessed outcomes at more than three months after final treatment, and longer-term assessments are mostly not covered in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: High-quality evidence on the use of light therapies for people with acne is lacking. There is low certainty of the usefulness of MAL-PDT (red light) or ALA-PDT (blue light) as standard therapies for people with moderate to severe acne.Carefully planned studies, using standardised outcome measures, comparing the effectiveness of common acne treatments with light therapies would be welcomed, together with adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

AB  - Current topical and most oral therapies for acne vulgaris have limited efficacy, especially in moderate to severe cases. Photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid and recently methyl aminolevulinate has been shown to be a safe and effective modality for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Consensus guidelines suggest that 30 to 60 minutes is sufficient 5-aminolevulinic acid contact time before photoactivation with blue light, red light, yellow light, broadband light, halogen, or pulsed dye laser devices. An average of three treatment can yield significant long-term improvement.

AB  - Lipophilic propionibacterium acnes stores large amounts of porphyrins. This peculiarity can be used for photodynamic destruction of propionibacteria. After repeated irradiations with a blue light-type high pressure lamp (Narva NC 1000-64) both acne and seborrhoea was improved markedly (10 irradiations, each for 10 minutes, cumulative light dose 325 J/cm2). Also porphyrin content inside acne follicles dropped. Serial irradiations with short range visible light (400 to 420 nm) are recommended for acne treatment during the light-poor season of the year.

AB  - Acne vulgaris continues to be a challenge to dermatologists and primary care physicians alike. The available treatments reflect the complex and multifactorial contributors to acne pathogenesis, with topical retinoids as first-line therapy for mild acne, topical retinoids in combination with anti-microbials for moderate acne, and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Unfortunately, these conventional therapies may not be effective against refractory acne, can lead to antibiotic resistance, and is associated with adverse effects. With the rise of new technologies and in-office procedures, light and laser therapy, photodynamic therapy, chemical peels, and comedo extraction are growing in popularity as adjunctive treatments and may offer alternatives to those who desire better efficacy, quicker onset of action, improved safety profile, reduced risk of antibiotic resistance, and non-systemic administration. Whereas adjunctive therapies are generally well-tolerated, the number of randomized controlled trials are few and limited by small sample sizes. Furthermore, results demonstrating efficacy of certain light therapies are mixed and studies involving photodynamic therapy and chemical peels have yet to standardize and optimize application, formulation, and exposure times. Nevertheless, adjunctive therapies, particularly blue light and photodynamic therapy, show promise as these treatments also target factors of acne pathogenesis and may potentially complement current conventional therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonablative 1,450-nm diode laser (DL) and visible blue light (BL) have been effectively used for acne with superior safety profiles. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate synergistic effects of sequential DL and BL application for acne. METHODS: A 20-week, randomized split-face study was conducted to compare clinical courses between 2 facial sides either receiving sequential application of DL and BL or BL alone in 24 patients with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris. Patients were scheduled to receive 3 consecutive sessions at 4-week intervals. Objective assessments, including revised Leeds grades, lesion counts, and sebum output measurements, and patients' subjective satisfaction were investigated. RESULTS: Both combination and BL sides demonstrated steady improvement of inflammatory acne lesions with 62.3% and 35.2% decreases at the 12-week follow-up visit compared with baseline respectively. For noninflammatory lesions and seborrhea, only combination regimen demonstrated improvement. Patients' subjective assessments paralleled objective findings. For safety profiles, no severe adverse effect was observed on both sides, and mild symptoms resolved spontaneously within a day. CONCLUSION: The combination regimen demonstrated synergistic efficacies for acne and seborrhea, with satisfactory safety profiles. Therefore, a few sessions of these light-based applications would be a viable option for acne treatments.

AB  - With the advent of short contact and pulsed light techniques, topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (5-ALA PDT) has become a viable clinical modality. Intense pulsed light, the pulsed dye laser, and blue light-emitting lamps have become the most commonly used devices in inducing a cosmetic PDT effect. More recently, by combining the photothermal effects of pulsed light with the photochemical effects of PDT, an enhanced cosmetic effect has been demonstrated in a variety of dermatologic conditions. In addition, the use of shorter 5-ALA incubation times allows for improved patient tolerance during treatment and subsequently fewer adverse effects in the postoperative period. A review of the current literature on cosmetic uses of PDT as well as our personal techniques are discussed in detail.

AB  - Effective medications to treat acne sometimes become unavailable in certain countries, either for economic reasons or for shortage of them in the pharmaceutical market. The purpose of this report is to review a series of drugs of topical and systemic use; some old and some new. The topical group includes agents such as sulfur, salicylic acid and the alpha-hydroxy acids, while the systemic group includes diaminodiphenylsulfone, clofazimine, ibuprofen and others. Some presumably useful physical methodologies and the recent findings in phototherapy, particularly the properties of blue light and blue-red light, are also reviewed. Finally, we report on the results obtained from the combined use of isotretinoin and methylprednisone in severe inflammatory acne, to prevent a possible triggering of the 'pseudo' acne fulminans.

AB  - Blue light, particularly in the wavelength range of 405-470 nm, has attracted increasing attention due to its intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the addition of exogenous photosensitizers. In addition, it is commonly accepted that blue light is much less detrimental to mammalian cells than ultraviolet irradiation, which is another light-based antimicrobial approach being investigated. In this review, we discussed the blue light sensing systems in microbial cells, antimicrobial efficacy of blue light, the mechanism of antimicrobial effect of blue light, the effects of blue light on mammalian cells, and the effects of blue light on wound healing. It has been reported that blue light can regulate multi-cellular behavior involving cell-to-cell communication via blue light receptors in bacteria, and inhibit biofilm formation and subsequently potentiate light inactivation. At higher radiant exposures, blue light exhibits a broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Blue light therapy is a clinically accepted approach for Propionibacterium acnes infections. Clinical trials have also been conducted to investigate the use of blue light for Helicobacter pylori stomach infections and have shown promising results. Studies on blue light inactivation of important wound pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been reported. The mechanism of blue light inactivation of P. acnes, H. pylori, and some oral bacteria is proved to be the photo-excitation of intracellular porphyrins and the subsequent production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. Although it may be the case that the mechanism of blue light inactivation of wound pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, P. aeruginosa) is the same as that of P. acnes, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Limited and discordant results have been reported regarding the effects of blue light on mammalian cells and wound healing. Under certain wavelengths and radiant exposures, blue light may cause cell dysfunction by the photo-excitation of blue light sensitizing chromophores, including flavins and cytochromes, within mitochondria or/and peroxisomes. Further studies should be performed to optimize the optical parameters (e.g., wavelength, radiant exposure) to ensure effective and safe blue light therapies for infectious disease. In addition, studies are also needed to verify the lack of development of microbial resistance to blue light.

AB  - Propionibacterium acnes is a Gram-positive, microaerophilic bacterium that causes skin wounds. It is known to naturally produce high amounts of intracellular porphyrins. The results of the present study confirm that the investigated strain of P. acnes is capable of producing endogenic porphyrins with no need for any trigger molecules. Extracts from growing cultures have demonstrated emission peaks around 612 nm when excited at 405 nm, which are characteristic for porphyrins. Endogenic porphyrins were determined and quantified after their extraction from the bacterial cells by fluorescence intensity and by elution retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The porphyrins produced by P. acnes are mostly coproporphyrin, as shown by the HPLC elution patterns. Addition of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) enhanced intracellular porphyrin synthesis and higher amounts of coproporphyrin have been found. Eradication of P. acnes by its endogenic porphyrins was examined after illumination with intense blue light at 407-420 nm. The viability of 24 h cultures grown anaerobically in liquid medium was reduced by less than two orders of magnitude when illuminated once with a light dose of 75 J cm(-2). Better photodynamic effects were obtained when cultures were illuminated twice or three times consecutively with a light dose of 75 J cm(-2) and an interval of 24 h between illuminations. The viability of the culture under these conditions decreased by four orders of magnitude after two illuminations and by five orders of magnitude after three illuminations. When ALA-triggered cultures were illuminated with intense blue light at a light dose of 75 J cm(-2) the viability of the treated cultures decreased by seven orders of magnitude. This decrease in viability can occur even after a single exposure of illumination for the indicated light intensity. X-ray microanalysis and transmission electron microscopy revealed structural damages to membranes in the illuminated P. acnes. Illumination of the endogenous coproporphyrin with blue light (407-420 nm) apparently plays a major role in P. acnes photoinactivation. A treatment protocol with a series of several illuminations or illumination after application of ALA may be suitable for curing acne. Treatment by both pathways may overcome the resistance of P. acnes to antibiotic treatment.

AB  - The medical treatment of acne is generally sufficient to meet the expectations of acne patients. However, in a number of situations additional therapeutic approaches may be advisable. There are a wide variety of useful physical methods. They range from electromagnetic waves, usually light, to peeling and manual therapy. Phototherapy of acne includes not just visible light but also laser and flash lamp therapy. The present review provides an overview on the evidence. Visible light, in particular blue light, provides an effective option for treatment of inflammatory acne. Photodynamic therapy also is efficacious; however, it should not be used because of an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. UV treatment of acne is obsolete. Newer studies on the use of a variety of laser systems and flash lamps have demonstrated in part rewarding results.

While the efficacy of laser treatment is still uncertain, photodynamic therapy shows promising results, but with marked side-effects, as destruction of sebaceous glands. Treatment with blue light (405-420 nm wavelength) also appears effective and can be regarded as an treatment option for inflammatory acne.

AB  - Acne surgery is the use of various surgical procedures for the treatment of postacne scarring and also, as adjuvant treatment for active acne. Surgery is indicated both in active acne and post-acne scars. PHYSICIANS' QUALIFICATIONS: Any Dermatologist can perform most acne surgery techniques as these are usually taught during postgraduation. However, certain techniques such as dermabrasion, laser resurfacing, scar revisions need specific "hands-on" training in appropriate training centers. FACILITY: Most acne surgery procedures can be performed in a physician's minor procedure room. However, full-face dermabrasion and laser resurfacing need an operation theatre in a hospital setting. ACTIVE ACNE: Surgical treatment is only an adjunct to medical therapy, which remains the mainstay of treatment. Comedone extraction is a process of applying simple mechanical pressure with a comedone extractor, to extract the contents of the blocked pilosebaceous follicle. Superficial chemical peel is a process of applying a chemical agent to the skin, so as to cause controlled destruction of the epidermis leading to exfoliation. Glycolic acid, salicylic acid and trichloroacetic acid are commonly used peeling agents for the treatment of active acne and superficial acne scars. CRYOTHERAPY: Cryoslush and cryopeel are used for the treatment of nodulocystic acne. Intralesional corticosteroids are indicated for the treatment of nodules, cysts and keloidal acne scars. Nonablative lasers and light therapy using Blue light, non ablative radiofrequency, Nd:YAG laser, IPL (Intense Pulsed Light), PDT (Photodynamic Therapy), pulse dye laser and light and heat energy machines have been used in recent years for the treatment of active inflammatory acne and superficial acne scars. Proper counseling is very important in the treatment of acne scars. Treatment depends on the type of acne scars; a patient may need more than one type of treatment. Subcision is a treatment to break the fibrotic strands that tether the scar to the underlying subcutaneous tissue, and is useful for rolling scars. Punch excision techniques such as punch excision, elevation and replacement are useful for depressed scars such as ice pick and boxcar scars. TCA chemical reconstruction of skin scars (CROSS) (Level C) is useful for ice pick scars. Resurfacing techniques include ablative methods (such as dermabrasion and laser resurfacing), and nonablative methods such as microdermabrasion and nonablative lasers. Ablative methods cause significant postoperative changes in the skin, are associated with significant healing time and should be performed by dermatosurgeons trained and experienced in the procedure. Fillers are useful for depressed scars. Proper case selection is very important in ensuring satisfactory results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a variety of laser/light-based devices have been reported to be effective for the treatment of acne, long-term data on efficacy and safety in the management of moderate and severe inflammatory acne is lacking. The objective of this 12-week clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the KLOX BioPhotonic System, a LED blue light device using specific photo-converter chromophores, in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. METHODS: One patient hemiface was randomly selected to receive 6 weeks of treatment (twice weekly) with the LED light and the photo-converter chromophores whereas the contralateral hemiface was not treated with the BioPhotonic System. All patients were provided with a skin cleanser and a non-comedogenic cream with ultraviolet protection to be used on the entire face during the treatment period. Following completion of the 6-week treatment period, the patient was followed for an additional 6 weeks. Efficacy was assessed through changes in acne severity using the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale and inflammatory acne lesion counts, both evaluated against baseline at weeks 6 and 12. Safety was assessed through physical exam, vital signs, laboratory evaluations, and physician and patient reporting of adverse events. RESULTS: A reduction of at least two grades in IGA scale severity was demonstrated in 51.7% of patients at week 12. Furthermore, at week 12, subjects with a baseline IGA grade of 3 (moderate) demonstrated a success rate (2 or greater grade drop) of 45.3% whereas patients with a baseline IGA grade of 4 (severe) demonstrated a success rate of 61.1%. Acne inflammatory lesion counts confirmed these results, with a reduction of at least 40% of lesions in 81.6% of treated hemifaces after 12 weeks. Treatment was considered as safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse event and no patient discontinuation from the study from any adverse event. Patients' quality of life was also improved with a decrease of pain linked to acne after the 6-week treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The BioPhotonic System comprised of LED blue-light phototherapy and photo-converter chromophores was found to be efficacious and safe, with a sustained clinical response at 12 weeks for the management of moderate to severe facial inflammatory acne.

AB  - A variety of laser/light-based devices have been reported to be effective for the treatment of acne, yet no long-term data on efficacy and safety have been published. A first 12-week clinical trial ("Main trial") recently demonstrated that the KLOX BioPhotonic System, an LED blue light device using photo-converter chromophores, can significantly improve moderate and severe facial acne vulgaris with an excellent safety profile. This Extension trial followed the Main trial, using the same BioPhotonic System, with the same dose and instructions for use, on patients having already completed treatment in the Main trial. Main objectives of this open-label long-term extension 12-week study were to evaluate the efficacy of the KLOX BioPhotonic System on the untreated hemiface during the Main trial, as well as the duration of response on the hemiface treated during the first 12-week Main trial. Despite their young age (mean age: 21.6 years) and their 12-week participation in the Main trial, 49 (54.4%) of the total number of patients who participated in the Main trial enrolled in this additional 12-week Extension trial. Baseline grading of acne was performed with the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale. For each patient, the hemiface randomly selected as a control during the Main trial received 6 weeks of treatment (twice weekly) and was then followed up for an additional 6 weeks. The first hemiface treated in the Main trial was consequently observed throughout the Extension trial, allowing for a further 12-week assessment of outcomes (total 24 weeks). In light of an additional 12 weeks of treatment on the contralateral face, the patient compliance rate was excellent, with 91.9% of the total number of patients receiving at least 80% of the treatments. Patients with a baseline IGA grade of 2 (mild) on the treated hemiface demonstrated a success rate of 58.3 and 66.7% at weeks 6 and 12, respectively. At these same time points, subjects with a baseline IGA grade of 3 (moderate) demonstrated a success rate of 81.8 and 90.0%. Patients with a baseline IGA grade of 4 (severe) demonstrated a success rate of 100% at both week 6 and week 12. When evaluating the originally treated hemifaces from the Main trial, the rate of return to baseline at 24 weeks was calculated to be 15.5%. This latter outcome confirmed the long duration of effect following treatment. The patient safety profile was also excellent, with very few related adverse events. The BioPhotonic System, which is comprised of LED blue light phototherapy and photo-converter chromophores, provides long-term efficacy and safety in the treatment of acne vulgaris, with a rate of compliance above what is generally observed in a young population of patients suffering from acne vulgaris, especially in light of sequential enrollment in a study treating one hemiface.

AB  - Approximately 50% of the sunlight reaching the Earth's surface is visible light (400-700 nm). Other sources of visible light include lasers, light-emitting diodes, and flash lamps. Photons from visible light are absorbed by photoreceptive chromophores (e.g., melanin, heme, and opsins), altering skin function by activating and imparting energy to chromophores. Additionally, visible light can penetrate the full thickness of the skin and induce pigmentation and erythema. Clinically, lasers and light devices are used to treat skin conditions by utilizing specific wavelengths and treatment parameters. Red and blue light from light-emitting diodes and intense pulsed light have been studied as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory treatments for acne. Pulsed dye lasers are used to treat vascular lesions in adults and infants. Further research is necessary to determine the functional significance of visible light on skin health without confounding the influence of ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths.

AB  - The first-line treatments for acne vulgaris are conventional topical and/or oral medications. However, many patients have contraindications, only partial response, significant adverse effects, or recurrence. Light-based treatments and photodynamic therapy (PDT) using topical precursors of porphyrins are off-label alternative treatments for acne vulgaris, with their own advantages and disadvantages. To date, there is no consensus on PDT methodology and parameters. An understanding of pathophysiology of acne, light-tissue interactions, and PDT mechanisms of action is helpful whenever PDT is considered as an alternative treatment. In general, blue light alone improves acne because of its antiinflammatory effects. PDT using 5-aminolevulenic acid (ALA) or ALA derivatives induces transient antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects. At high doses, red light PDT may induce inhibition or destruction of sebaceous glands, resulting in clinical improvement. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to compare different treatments of acne, recognize when photodynamic therapy may be a useful off-label treatment for acne vulgaris, and identify variables that may affect the efficacy of photodynamic therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to rapid advances in modern technologies such as telecommunication technology, the world has witnessed an exponential growth in the use of digital handheld devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets). This drastic growth has resulted in increased global concerns about the safety of these devices. Smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other digital screens emit high levels of short-wavelength visible light (i.e. blue color region in the visible light spectrum). MATERIAL AND METHODS: At a dark environment, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria were exposed to the light emitted from common tablets/smartphones. The control samples were exposed to the same intensity of light generated by a conventional incandescent light bulb. The growth rate of bacteria was examined by measuring the optical density (OD) at 625 nm by using a spectrophotometer before the light exposure and after 30 to 330 minutes of light exposure. RESULTS: The growth rates of bacteria in both smartphone and tablet groups were higher than that of the control group and the maximum smartphone/control and tablet/control growth ratios were observed in samples exposed to digital screens' light for 300 min (ratios of 3.71 and 3.95, respectively). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the effect of exposure to light emitted from digital screens on the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus and its association with acne pathogenesis. Our findings show that exposure to short-wavelength visible light emitted from smartphones and tablets can increase the proliferation of Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - Introduction: Cutibacterium acnes is gaining recognition as a leading pathogen after orthopaedic shoulder procedures. Photodynamic therapy, a combination of light and a photosensitizer, has demonstrated antimicrobial activity against C. acnes in the treatment of acne vulgaris. We sought to evaluate the effect of photodynamic therapy using blue light and photosensitizers on C. acnes isolates from shoulder prosthetic joint infections. Methods: C. acnes strains isolated from 19 patients with shoulder PJI were exposed to blue light alone (415 nm) or in combination with photosensitizers (fluorescein, riboflavin and demeclocycline). C. acnes strains were divided into 4 categories: Highly Sensitive (HS), Sensitive (S), Weakly Sensitive (WS), Resistant to blue light. Results: 13 of 19 C. acnes strains (68%) were S or HS to blue light alone. Of these 19 strains tested, 11 were tested with blue light and fluorescein or blue light plus riboflavin. Fluorescein (1 µg/mL) enhanced the effect of blue light in 6 of 11 strains (55%). Blue light plus riboflavin (10 µg/mL) resulted enhanced killing in 3 of 11 strains (27%), but produced a paradoxical photoprotective effect in 4 of 11 strains (36%), resulting in a net decrease compared to blue light alone. Demeclocycline, however, enhanced the effect of blue light in 16 of 17 strains (94 %). Conclusions: Blue light with the addition of photosensitizers killed C. acnes from periprosthetic shoulder infections in vitro, with demeclocycline having the most pronounced effect.

AB  - Background: We have previously reported clinical efficacy with a novel form of photobiomodulation-a biophotonic platform inducing fluorescent light energy (FLE)-in both disease-affected and healthy skin; however, the cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Objective: This study investigated the cellular mechanism of action of FLE on key skin and immune cells. Methods: We examined the effects of FLE on the clinical presentation of inflammation in a representative patient with acne vulgaris. The effect of FLE and an FLE-mimicking control lamp on collagen production from primary human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells was assessed in the presence and absence of the proinflammatory cytokine, interferon gamma (IFN-γ). Cytokine production was assessed from HDF and human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) exposed to M1 macrophage-conditioned media following illumination with either a blue light-emitting diode (LED) or FLE. Finally, the effects of FLE on angiogenesis were assessed in human aortic endothelial (HAE) cells. Results: FLE reduced inflammatory lesions and associated redness in the representative acne patient. Following the resolution of inflammation there was an overall enhancement of the skin's texture. FLE enhanced collagen production from nonstressed HDF cells, decreased the inflammatory profile of HDF and HEK cells, and enhanced angiogenesis in HAE cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest FLE is capable of enhancing collagen production, modulating cutaneous inflammation, and encouraging angiogenesis. While further research is required, our findings have important implications for approaches to treating inflammatory skin conditions and achieving better aesthetic outcomes.

AB  - This study was an evaluation of self-applied, blue light, light-emitting diode therapy in the treatment of mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne on the face and associated labeling to determine if subjects are capable of self diagnosing their condition and whether they are capable of self-administrating treatment. Subjects included had no prior experience with the device. They were given the device and a copy of the labeling. Based on their own assessment, they were evaluated for their comprehension of the device and for its intended use. The study, which comprised 18 females and three males with an average age of 31, demonstrated that all participants (100%) were capable of correctly identifying their acne condition. The labeling, which was key to educating users in recognizing their acne type, included clear descriptions of different categories of acne. The study also demonstrated that the user was capable of self administering the treatment based solely on the device's labeling and without the supervision of a medical doctor.

AB  - This study was an evaluation of the performance of self-applied, blue light, light-emitting diode therapy in the treatment of mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne on the face, concerning: 1) time to improvement and/or resolution of the number of blemishes and lesions on the face; 2) quality of skin condition; 3) occurrence and count of the number of new blemishes and lesions; and 4) ease of product use; patient comfort, wellbeing, and satisfaction during the treatment period; and safety of treatment. Subjects (N=21) were included according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria and after they had given informed consent. The blue light treatment was conducted over an eight-week period. For study data management and analysis, SPSS 16.0 statistical software was used. Data management and analysis was performed independently using, where appropriate, ANOVA, student t-test, and Mann-Whitney test for N=20. Tests were carried out at the five-percent significance level. The confidence interval was 95 percent. Twenty-one subjects concluded the study (18/21 were female and 3/21 were male). Upon the first outbreak of acne, subjects had a mean age of 15 years (range 8-28 years), and 19 subjects had mild-to-moderate acne for a mean duration of 13.1 years. During the study period with self-applied blue light treatment, the total number of comedones on the face had significantly reduced for the assessment at Day 7 (p<0.019) and at Day 28 (p<0.001). The total number of open comedones (blackheads) on the face during the treatment period was reduced significantly (p<0.02) for assessment at treatment Day 7 (p<0.005) and for the assessment at Day 28. The total number of closed comedones (whiteheads) on the face during the treatment period, was reduced significantly (p<0.007) for the assessment at Day 28. The total number of papules during treatment had reduced significantly for assessment at Day 7 (p<0.048) and Day 28 (p<0.005). The total number of pustules during treatment had reduced, but this difference was not statistically significant. This was similar for nodules present. Subjects expressed confidence in using the self-applied blue light without the supervision of a doctor. Regarding previous treatments, subjects expressed dissatisfaction and considered self-applied blue light treatment to be better for their condition. Self-applied blue light treatment was reported to be easy and safe to use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Topical and oral medications, such as retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, and isotretinoin, have been the standard of care for the treatment of mild-to-moderate acne for the last several decades. More recently, a number of pubHshed studies on optical treatments, such as ultraviolet light, visible (blue) light, and intense pulsed Hght systems, have also shown clinical improvement in the appearance of acne. Specifically, photopneumatic technology, which utilizes gentle pneumatic energy (vacuum) to draw the target tissue into the treatment tip and then deHver broadband pulsed Hght to the dermal targets, has demonstrated marked improvement in the appearance of acne lesions and side effects associated with acne. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using a combination treatment of the photopneumatic system and profusion therapy using three currently marketed topical agents for the treatment of mild-to-moderate acne on the face and/or body, including neck, chest, or back. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, dinical trial of 41 individuals with mild-to-moderate acne was performed. Patients received up to four treatments at 1- to 2-week intervals with the photopneumatic system and profusion therapy with three separate topical agents. Study investigators and subjects evaluated dinical efficacy at 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits. RESULTS: At three months, a 69-percent reduction was noted in inflamed acne lesions and a 41-percent reduction in noninflamed acne lesions was noted by physician assessment. Additionally, at this same time point, subjects reported moderate-to-marked (26-75%) improvement in acne lesions. Eighty-one percent of subjects (22/27) were either satisfied or very satisfied with treatment outcome. There were no adverse events caused by malfunction of the device, and no serious adverse events or deaths. CONCLUSION: The results, as well as the reported patient satisfaction and safety, suggest that the treatment of acne with the photopneumatic system in combination with profusion using currently available topical acne agents demonstrated significant treatment results.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of treating acne for eight weeks using a new blue light device at a dose of ˜2J/cm(2)/day (representing typical full-face treatment) or ˜29J/cm(2)/day (representing the typical dose after localized spot treatment of acne). DESIGN: Prospective, single-center, open-label study evaluating two levels of blue light in each subject. SETTING: Subjects were recruited from the local community for self-treatment at home. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two subjects with mild or moderate facial acne vulgaris. MEASUREMENTS: Inflammatory lesion count; number, severity, and redness of flares; improvement in skin characteristics (overall appearance, clarity, radiance, tone, texture, and smoothness); tolerability; subject satisfaction. RESULTS: The blue light treatment was associated with significant reductions from baseline in inflammatory lesion count as early as Week 1 with ˜29J/cm(2)/day and Week 3 with ˜2J/cm(2)/day (P≤ 0.01). It was also associated with significant reductions in the number, severity, and redness of flares and with improvements in the skin's appearance, clarity, radiance, tone, texture, and smoothness. Overall, 53 percent of subjects considered the treatment much gentler than traditional acne treatments and 61 percent were satisfied. Three adverse events were probably related to treatment-minimal transient skin dryness (2) and minimal transient hyperpigmentation (1). CONCLUSION: The blue light treatment is effective and well tolerated, offering rapid, gentle, and convenient treatment of inflammatory acne. The blue light device offers a valuable alternative to antibiotics and potentially irritating topical treatments and can also be used adjunctively to complement other therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition that affects 8 out of 10 people. It varies from mild to severe, and different treatments target various aspects of the disease. Propionibacterium acnes, one of the culprits involved in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, is the main target of all major medical treatments used. Studies conducted in recent years have shown favorable effects within the visible light spectrum for the treatment of acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we have evaluated the use of intense blue light within the spectral range of 415-425 nm (peak 420 nm) in the treatment of acne vulgaris. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with mild to moderate facial acne were treated with blue light phototherapy. All patients were given 14-min treatment sessions twice a week for 4 weeks. Acne severity was assessed using the Leeds Technique for grading and lesion counts. Disability was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). In addition, standard digital and cross-polarized light photographs were taken and graded by a blinded evaluator. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores and cultures for P. acnes were carried out before starting the treatment and upon completion of the treatment. RESULTS: Significant improvement was achieved in the Leeds Acne Grade (P = 0.001). The inflammatory (P = 0.001) and noninflammatory (P = 0.06) lesion counts also improved significantly. A similar change was noted in the DLQI (P = 0.001); a degree of significance was also achieved in the patients' and the investigators' VAS scores (P = 0.01 and P = 0.001, respectively). P. acnes colony counts failed to show a significant decrease at the end of the treatment and remained almost constant (P = 0.660). CONCLUSIONS: We believe that blue light does appear to have some role in the management of acne and may be beneficial for the treatment of a select group of mild to moderate acne patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used to treat actinic keratoses, superficial cutaneous carcinoma, photodamage, and/or acne. The aim of this study was to compare the usefulness of Avène thermal spring water (ATSW), a low mineral content spring water, to a high mineral content spring water. We evaluated post-PDT clinical symptoms and findings when used as an adjunctive therapy in postprocedure skin care. METHODS: A double-blind monocentric comparative study was conducted on 25 patients suffering from either vulgaris acne or photodamage with or without actinic keratoses. The patients were treated with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) activated with an intense pulsed light and/or blue light source. Patients were randomized so that 12 patients treated their faces with ATSW and 13 were treated with a comparative water spray. Clinical signs were evaluated by the investigator at day 0, before and 15 min after the first spraying, at days 2, 4, and 7, and each day from day 0 to day 6 by patients. Clinical signs (erythema, stinging, pruritus, pain, and tightening) were evaluated by the use of a 4-point grading scale. RESULTS: The intragroup analysis showed that pain was significantly reduced by ATSW spraying at days 2, 4, and 7. The evaluation by patients showed that only ATSW alleviates pain from day 3 to day 6. The between-group analysis revealed that pruritus was significantly reduced by ATSW at day 7. Erythema, stinging, and tightening were not significantly reduced by both waters. Patients wished to continue using ATSW in 83% of cases. CONCLUSION: This comparative clinical trial demonstrates that ATSW, a low mineral content spring water, can be useful after ALA-PDT in reducing postprocedure cutaneous inflammation and patient discomfort better than a high mineral content spring water.

AB  - Acne vulgaris is one of the most prevalent skin diseases known. As common as this condition is, the social and psychological consequences are limitless. Although current treatments are available and include topical or oral antibiotics, it is crucial to develop a less risky and more effective therapy such as light/laser therapy. This article focuses specifically on the benefits of the light/laser treatment on acne vulgaris. Porphyrins accumulated in the bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes, one of the etiologic factors involved in the pathogenesis, allows phototherapy to be a successful modality. They have specific absorption peaks at which lasers have optimal effects. The longer the wavelength of the light is, the deeper its penetration and thus the greater its damage to the sebaceous glands. Although blue light is best for the activation of porphyrins, red light is best for deeper penetration and an anti-inflammatory effect. Ultraviolet (UV) light, although it may have initial an anti-inflammatory effects, has been proven to be potentially carcinogenic and have adverse effects such as aging (by UV-A) and burning (by UV-B). Previous studies indicate successful long-term intervention and selective damage of the sebaceous glands by using a diode laser with indocyanine green (ICG) dye. Mid-infrared lasers have been found to decrease lesion counts while also reducing the oiliness of skin and the scarring process. Nonablative laser treatment of acne scars using the Er:YAG laser with a short-pulsed mode has been successful in reducing the appearance of scars by stimulating neocollagenesis. The light/laser therapy has started to be explored with promising results in highly selected patients that require further investigation in greater populations and well-designed protocols.

AB  - Topical and oral antibiotic therapy is also a popular method of treatment. The effectiveness of this method is limited by the increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. Over the decades since the introduction of antibiotics to treat acne, the resistance levels of bacteria have changed. This defense mechanism is developed evolutionarily. Modifications of antibiotic receptor sites, alteration of drug influx/efflux, or enzymatic degradation are common mechanisms used by bacteria to initiate and strengthen internal antibiotic resistance. The basic chromophores used in light therapy are hemoglobin, melanin, water bound to proteins, and porphyrins. Hemoglobin absorbs light mainly at 580 nm, while melanin absorbs the entire visible spectral range (400-750 nm). Porphyrins are aromatic compounds, classified as photosensitizing substances, intensively absorbing blue light, and to a lesser extent in long visible bands, such as orange and red light. Using IPL makes it possible to cover the maximum light absorption of porphyrins and hemoglobin, therefore it can be an effective tool in the treatment of inflammatory lesions in acne vulgaris. In view of the effectiveness of light therapy and its effect even on antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it is worth considering the possibility of using light therapy instead of antibiotic therapy. Due to the increasing resistance of bacteria to antimicrobials, they should be used with caution and as a last resort. The high-energy light treatment act only locally (unlike with antibiotics taken orally) and on a chromophore, such as melanin, hemoglobin, or porphyrins.

AB  - The treatment of acne vulgaris poses a challenge to the dermatologist, and the disease causes emotional anxiety for the patient. The treatment of acne vulgaris may be well-suited to home-use applications, where sufferers may be too embarrassed to seek medical treatment. This randomized controlled study is designed to quantify the effectiveness of using a blue light device in a therapy combined with proprietary creams, in the investigation of a self-treatment regimen. A total of 41 adults with mild-to-moderate facial inflammatory acne were recruited. The subjects were randomly assigned to combination blue light therapy (n = 26) or control (n = 15). Photography was used for qualitative assessment of lesion counts, at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. All subjects in the treatment cohort achieved a reduction in their inflammatory lesion counts after 12 weeks. The mean inflammatory lesion counts reduced by 50.02% in the treatment cohort, and increased by 2.45% in the control cohort. The reduction in inflammatory lesions was typically observable at week-3, and maximal between weeks 8 and 12. The treatment is free of pain and side-effects. The blue light device offers a valuable alternative to antibiotics and potentially irritating topical treatments. Blue light phototherapy, using a narrow-band LED light source, appears to be a safe and effective additional therapy for mild to moderate acne.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Available topical treatments are slow and frequently irritating. Oral therapies may be associated with increased bacterial resistance (antibiotics) or possible severe side effects (oral isotretinoin). In vitro and in vivo exposure of acne bacteria to 405-420 nm ultraviolet (UV) free blue light results in the photo-destruction of these bacteria through the effects on the porphyrins produced naturally by Propionibacterium acnes. A novel, high-intensity, narrow band 420 nm UV free blue light has been shown to decrease inflammatory acne lesions after eight bi-weekly treatments. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of high-intensity, narrow band 420 nm UV free blue light (ClearLight) on inflammatory acne lesions. METHODS: Three studies were carried out to examine the clinical effects of high-intensity, narrow band blue light on papulo-pustular acne: the split-face dose-response study, the full-face open trial and the split-face, double-blind controlled study. The studies enrolled 10, 13 and 23 patients respectively. RESULTS: The data show more than an 80% response to 420 nm acne phototherapy with a significant reduction of 59-67% of inflammatory acne lesions after only eight treatments of 8-15 minutes. The reduction in lesions was steady in the follow-ups at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the end of therapy. Prolonged remission was evident in the 8 weeks after the end of therapy. No adverse effects or patient discomfort were noted in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Acne phototherapy by high intensity, narrow band 405-420 nm light is proven to be an attractive, fast, effective, non-invasive alternative to current topical and parenteral anti-acne remedies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Blue-light light-emitting diode (LED) therapy has become widely used for the treatment of inflammatory acne. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of a home use blue-light LED application in improving lesions and shortening their time to clearance. METHODS: This was an IRB approved randomized self-control study. For each patient (n = 30), 2 similar lesions, one of each side of the face were chosen for treatment with either a blue-light LED hand-held or sham device. Treatments (n = 4) were conducted twice daily in the clinic and lesions were followed-up till resolution. Reduction in blemishes size and erythema and the overall improvement were evaluated by both the physician and the patients. Time to lesion resolution was recorded. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the response of lesions to the blue-light LED application as opposed to the placebo in terms of reduction in lesion size and lesion erythema as well as the improvement in the overall skin condition (p < 0.025). Signs of improvement were observed as early as post 2 treatments. Time to resolution was significantly shorter for the blue-light LED therapy. CONCLUSION: The results support the effectiveness of using blue-light LED therapy on a daily basis for better improvement and faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acne vulgaris represents both a challenge to the treating dermatologist and a major concern for the patient. Conventional treatments have proved inconsistent with often unacceptable side effects and high rates of recurrence. Non-thermal, non-laser, phototherapy for acne with a combination of blue and red light has recently attracted attention. The present study was designed to assess the efficacy of this combination phototherapy. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects, Fitzpatrick skin types II-V, with mild to severe symmetric facial acne vulgaris were recruited for the study. Subjects were well matched at baseline in terms of both age and duration of acne. Subjects were treated over eight sessions, two per week 3 days apart, alternating between 415 nm blue light (20 minutes/session, 48 J/cm2) and 633 nm red light (20 minutes/session, 96 J/cm2) from a light-emitting diode (LED)-based therapy system. Patients received a mild microdermabrasion before each session. Acne was assessed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients completed the trial. A mean reduction in lesion count was observed at all follow-up points. At the 4-week follow-up, the mean lesion count reduction was significant at 46% (p=0.001). At the 12-week follow-up, the mean lesion count reduction was also significant at 81% (p=0.001). Patient and dermatologist assessments were similar. Severe acne showed a marginally better response than mild acne. Side effects were minimal and transitory. Comedones did not respond as well as inflammatory lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Combination blue and red LED therapy appears to have excellent potential in the treatment of mild to severe acne. Treatment appears to be both pain- and side effect-free.

AB  - Acne is one of the commonest problems of adolescence with almost half of the patients experiencing persistence into adulthood. Pulsed dye lasers (PDL) with wavelengths of 585 and 595 nm targeting hemoglobin have been used for the treatment of this condition and its sequelae. Recent introduction of PDL with a higher wavelength of 1319 nm has been reported to offer some benefit to acne patients. We reviewed the literature on the use of 595-nm and 1319-nm PDL in the management of acne. A PubMed literature search for search terms "pulsed dye laser," "acne laser therapy," "light therapy for acne," "595 nm and acne," "1319 nm and acne" was done. Studies, series and case reports were included. These lasers were compared to other lasers and light sources such as 532-nm Potassium Titanyl Phosphate laser, 585-nm PDLs, 1450-nm diode laser, 1540-nm erbium glass laser, intense-pulsed light (IPL), photodynamic therapy, red and blue light and short-pulsed 1064 nm laser utilized in acne management regarding their efficacy. Improvement in acne grading, scale severity or reduction in lesion count indicated substantial efficacy of the laser system utilized.

AB  - A novel photopneumatic (PPX) technology, combining blue light-emitting diode (LED) and broadband intense pulsed light (IPL) with vacuum pressure, was developed for the treatment of acne vulgaris (AV). In this study, we enrolled 50 patients with mild to moderate AV. Five successive treatments were performed on one side of the face with a combined PPX device, and the opposite side was treated with only IPL with the same fluences at 2-week intervals. Clinical improvement was evaluated by inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesion counts. Additionally, patient self-assessment scores were assessed. The results showed that inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesion counts were significantly improved on both sides of the face after treatment (p < .001, p = .001, respectively). Both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts were significantly reduced on the side treated with PPX when compared to the side treated with IPL alone (p = .008, p = .045, respectively). Thirty-eight of 44 patients reported slight to moderate improvement on the patient self-assessment score. No significant side effect was observed during the study periods.In conclusion, PPX therapy is an effective and safe modality to treat mild to moderate AV. This study shows that PPX therapy has superior efficacy for the treatment of AV compared to IPL monotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Topical antibiotics, isotretinoin or systemic antibiotics are usually used for acne therapy. However, isotretinoin cannot be used during pregnancy because it can cause significant birth defects while systemic antibiotics can have adverse side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation, photosensitivity and tetracycline sensitivity. Describe here is a high-intensity, narrow-band, blue light (ClearLight) system, and its therapeutic clinical effect is investigated on acne using cutaneous measurements, bacterial observations and ultrastructural changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 28 adult healthy volunteers with facial acne (mean age 28.1 years, range 16-56 years) were recruited for this study. They were treated with a total of eight serial biweekly 15-minute treatment sessions. Clinical counts of acne, as well as moisture, sebum and pH measurements were taken between each session. Nine of the 28 patients were followed for 2-3 months after the last treatment. Detection of bacteria in acne pustules was analyzed by culture and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ultrastructural changes were examined in eight patients after four sessions of the light therapy. RESULTS: All patients completed the study. Overall, there was a 64.7% improvement in acne lesions. There were no bacterial changes before or after the therapy, although damaged Propionibacterium acnes were observed at the ultrastructural level. CONCLUSIONS: ClearLight performed eight times over 4 weeks can be useful in the treatment of acne. Further investigation will be needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of ClearLight.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acne is a very prevalent skin disorder, and several devices, such as blue light, pulsed dye laser, diode laser, LED, RF and pulsed light systems, have been reported to have varying degrees of efficacy for treatment. Photopneumatic therapy (PPX) is a novel technology that combines pneumatic energy with a broadband light source to manipulate the optical characteristics of the skin. A vacuum suction raises target structures in the dermis closer to the surface of the skin prior to exposure, allowing for more efficient energy transmission. This study tested the hypothesis that a combination of pulsed light and suction would affect sebaceous plugging within diseased pilosebaceous apparati at a histological level, resulting in the rapid clearance of acne lesions. METHODS: Eight individuals were treated with PPX once per week for a total of five treatments. Punch biopsies of the treated areas were obtained just after the first exposure, just before the third exposure and immediately after the fifth exposure. Those specimens were examined by conventional and by electron microscopy for any alterations following treatment. RESULTS: Immediately following the first treatment, the mechanical extrusion of comedo contents from the infundibulum was observed histologically. One week after the second treatment, thermally injured bacteria as well as direct thermal injury to pilosebaceous apparati were observed ultrastructurally. CONCLUSION: These results correlate with clinical reports on decreased sebaceous gland activity after PPX treatment and may mechanistically give rise to the rapid regression of acne lesions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of acne remains a challenge, with current therapies linked to significant side effects and patient non-compliance. Phototherapy using blue light has been proven in the treatment of acne vulgaris and offers the clinician an effective alternative. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of narrowband light-emitting diode (LED) blue light in the reduction of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions in patients with mild to moderate acne and to evaluate patient tolerance of the therapy. METHODS: Forty-five patients were treated with high-intensity pure blue light, 415 nm and 48 J/cm2, receiving two treatments of 20 minutes per week for a period of 4-8 weeks. Clinical assessment was performed at baseline, and 2, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. A patient's therapeutic response was measured using a global improvement scoring system. RESULTS: The mean improvement score was 3.14 at 4 weeks and 2.90 at 8 weeks. Nine patients experienced complete clearing at 8 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated, with 50% of patients highly satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSION: This open-label study suggests the therapeutic efficacy of high-intensity LED pure blue light in the treatment of acne vulgaris with no reported side effects.

AB  - Propionibacterium acnes naturally produces endogenous porphyrins that are composed of coproporphyrin III (CPIII) and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Red light alone and photodynamic therapy (PDT) improve acne vulgaris clinically, but there remains a paucity of quantitative data that directly examine the bactericidal effects that result from PDT on P. acnes itself in vitro. The purpose of this study was to measure the difference of bactericidal effects of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT with red and blue light on P. acnes. P. acnes were cultured under anaerobic conditions and divided into two groups (ALA-treated group and control group), and were then illuminated with blue (415 nm) and red (635 nm) lights using a light-emitting diode (LED). The cultured P. acnes were killed with both blue and red LED light illumination. The efficacy increased with larger doses of light and a greater number of consecutive illuminations. We demonstrated that red light phototherapy was less effective for the eradication of P. acnes than blue light phototherapy without the addition of ALA. However, pretreatment with ALA could enhance markedly the efficacy of red light phototherapy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of phototherapy with a newly-developed high-intensity, enhanced, narrow-band, blue light source in patients with mild to moderate acne. An open study was performed in acne patients who were treated twice a week up to 5 weeks. Acne lesions were reduced by 64%. Two patients experienced dryness. No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. In vitro investigation revealed that irradiation from this light source reduced the number of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), but not Staphylococcus epidermidis that were isolated from the acne patients. Phototherapy using this blue light source was effective and well tolerated in acne patients and had an ability to decrease numbers of P. acnes in vitro, suggesting that this phototherapy may be a new modality for the treatment of acne.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effective management of acne remains a challenge; achieving an optimal response whilst minimizing adverse events is often difficult. The rise in antibiotic resistance threatens to reduce the future usefulness of the current mainstay of therapy. The need for alternative therapies remains important. Phototherapy has previously been shown to be effective in acne, with renewed interest as both endogenous and exogenous photodynamic therapies are demonstrated for this condition. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of narrowband blue light in the reduction of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions in patients with mild to moderate acne and to evaluate patient tolerance of the therapy. METHODS: We performed an open study utilizing a blue LED light source in 30 subjects with mild to moderate facial acne. Two weeks after screening, lesions were counted and recorded by lesion type. Over 4 weeks, patients received eight 10- or 20-minute light treatments, peak wavelength 409-419 nm at 40 mW/cm2. Assessments were taken at weeks 5, 8 and 12 and lesion counts were recorded. Repeated measures-ANOVA and Dunnett's tests, respectively, allowed assessment of the different scores over time and permitted comparison of mean counts. RESULTS: An overall effect on inflammatory counts was observed at week 5, and a statistically significant decrease in inflamed counts was detected at the week 8 assessments, which continued to week 12. There was little effect on non-inflamed lesions. The treatment was well tolerated with adverse events experienced generally rated as being mild and usually self-limiting. CONCLUSIONS: Eight 10- or 20-minute treatments over 4 weeks with a narrowband blue light was found to be effective in reducing the number of inflamed lesions in subjects with mild to moderate acne. The treatment had little effect on the number of comedones. The onset of the effect was observable at the first assessment, at week 5, and maximal between weeks 8 and 12. Blue light phototherapy using a narrowband LED light source appears to be a safe and effective additional therapy for mild to moderate acne.

AB  - Acne is a frequent skin disease with abnormalities in the process of keratinization, sebaceous gland functioning and inflammation. In this review, our understanding of the pathogenesis of acne has been updated. An overview of efficacy and side effects of available anti-acne treatments is presented. Based on the present overview a recommendation for the treatment of various manifestations of acne is provided, also reconciling beneficial combinations of treatments. It is attractive to speculate that the increased insight into the pathogenesis of acne will create new treatment options. Challenging new options comprise blue light, photodynamic therapy, retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents and inhibitors of Th-1 cytokines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne patients who fail to respond to conventional treatments have been treated with isotretinoin, an effective treatment coming under strict regulation due to the risk of significant side effects. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be a viable alternative treatment for recalcitrant acne of various types and levels of severity. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of combination PDT with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and activation by long-pulsed, pulsed dye laser (LP PDL, 595 nm) energy with topical therapy in patients with mild to severe acne. METHODS: A prospective, controlled pilot, proof-of-principle study of 19 consecutive patients (aged 16-47 years, Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI) with mild to severe cystic, inflammatory, or comedonal acne of the face was conducted. All patients had failed conventional therapy, including oral antibiotics, topical treatments, hormonal therapy, laser procedures (without ALA), and/or oral isotretinoin. Fifteen patients were treated with ALA PDT and 4 patients served as controls; all were continued on topical medications. Patients undergoing PDT were initially randomized to receive either blue light or laser energy. Because recrudescence occurred in 1 patient while undergoing multiple treatments with ALA and blue light, all subsequent patients were treated with ALA and laser energy. The total number of patients treated with LP PDL-mediated ALA PDT was 14. ALA was applied for a short 45-minute incubation followed by 1 minimally overlapping pass with the LP PDL (595 nm, 7.0-7.5 J/cm2 fluence, 10-ms pulse duration, 10-mm spot size, and dynamic cooling spray of 30 ms with a 30-ms delay). Patients treated with conventional therapy (oral antibiotics, oral contraceptives, and topical medications) or laser energy without ALA PDT served as control groups. Patients were followed monthly for up to 13 months. RESULTS: Complete clearance was achieved in 100% (14 out of 14) patients in the LP PDL PDT-treated group. A mean of 2.9 treatments (range 1-6; 2.0-3.7, 95% CI; n=14) was required to achieve complete clearance for a mean follow-up time of 6.4 months (range 1-13; 3.8-8.9 95% CI; n=14). The patient mean percent lesional clearance rate per treatment was 77% (64%-90%, 95% CI; n=14). Improvement in acne lesions became apparent within 1 to 2 weeks after the first treatment. Clearance in the LP PDL PDT group was superior to control groups. In the LP PDL-only control group (n=2), the patient mean percent lesional clearance rate per treatment was 32% without complete clearance after 3 to 4 treatments. In the oral antibiotics, oral contraceptives, and topicals control group (n=2), the clearance rate per treatment was 20%, the mean clearance rate per month was 4%, and complete clearance was not achieved after 6 to 10 months. In the LP PDL-mediated PDT group, treatments were well-tolerated with minimal erythema lasting 1 to 2 days. No cases of crusting, blistering, purpura, scarring, or dyspigmentation occurred. A reduction in the erythema in erythematous acne scars was observed. CONCLUSION: For teenage to adult patients with recalcitrant comedonal, inflammatory, or cystic acne of various degrees of severity, ALA PDT with activation by LP PDL appears to be a safe and effective treatment with minimal side effects. LP PDL-mediated PDT may serve as an important alternative to isotretinoin. Cosmetically well-accepted, LP PDL PDT combined with topical therapy is the first PDT modality to achieve complete clearance with long-term follow-up as compared to controls.

AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is currently approved in the US and Canada for the spot treatment of non-hypertrophic actinic keratoses of the face and scalp. Dermatologists are currently using ALA-PDT on larger skin surfaces for the treatment of extensive actinic keratoses, sun damage P and acne. This article reviews the safety and efficacy of large surface ALA-PDT for the treatment of actinic keratoses and photodamage. New data on the carcinogenic potential of weekly topical ALA-PDT in mice is also presented. Groups of hairless mice were treated weekly with either ALA alone, blue light alone or ALA-PDT using blue light for a total of 10 months followed by an additional 2 months or observation. Mice were examined weekly for the presence of skin tumors. Skin tumors were not observed in mice treated weekly with blue light alone, with topical application of ALA alone or with ALA-PDT.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A new 3-step protocol using broadband light allows patients with moderate to severe in ammatory acne to avoid potential side effects of systemic acne treatments and the risks and uncertainties associated with laser and light treatments to date. The protocol also addresses acne scarring and, with appropriate modi cations, all skin types. METHODS: The protocol consists of 6 to 8 treatments performed with a single device that allows the user to select wavelength, spot size, uence, and pulse duration. Step 1 uses blue light with a large spot size and low uence to kill Propionibacterium acnes. Step 2 features red and yellow light with a smaller spot size and higher uence, which together exert anti-in ammatory effects and trigger neocollagenesis. Step 3 employs visible and infrared (IR) light with a high uence and 12-second pulse length, delivered with a constant motion technique, to enhance previous results while also targeting areas of frequent breakouts. RESULTS: Challenging cases treated with the protocol include a young adult female with a nearly decade-long history of in ammatory and cystic acne. Her skin remained clear more than 6 months post-treatment. She reported her scarring reduction at 90%. Having treated more than 100 patients with the protocol, the author reports that approximately 80% of patients clear completely or achieve at least a 75% improvement in their in ammatory acne. Acne improvements start appearing 2 to 3 days after a treatment session. Red, purple, raised, or depressed acne scars less than 1 to 2 years old begin to fade 1 to 3 weeks post-treatment. CONCLUSION: The 3-step protocol is safe and effective for patients with moderate to severe in ammatory acne and acne scarring. <em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2016;15(11):1382-1388.</em>.

AB  - Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease treated by physicians. Current topical and oral treatments may have short- and long-term negative consequences. Since radiofrequency (RF) energy has been shown to reduce sebum production and 410-nm blue light has been shown to kill Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) cells, these modalities in combination should be a highly effective treatment of acne vulgaris with little or no downtime or risk. This case report describes the efficacy and safety of RF energy (Accent, Alma Lasers Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL) and blue light (BLU-U, Dusa Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Wilmington, MA) used in combination to treat grade 4 cystic acne and acne scars in an Asian woman of skin type IV. The results were considered excellent by both investigators and the patient, with improvement in the skin tone as an added cosmetic benefit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, often suppurative skin condition which affects primarily apocrine glands. A variety of therapies have been used to treat HS, often with unsatisfactory results. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), utilizing topical 20% 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is being used to treat a variety of dermatologic skin concerns, including photorejuvenation and associated actinic keratoses, and acne vulgaris, and other skin tumors. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of these case reports is to evaluate the effectiveness of ALA-PDT in treating recalcitrant cases of HS. METHODS: Four patients, not responding to standard HS therapy, underwent short-contact ALA-PDT therapy utilizing a blue light for activation. One to two week intervals between therapies was utilized for 3-4 total treatments and follow-up was for 3 months following the last treatment. RESULTS: All four of the patients tolerated the therapies well. Clinical improvements from 75-100% were noted n 11 of the patients. No adverse effects were seen during the treatments. The treatments were pain free and there was no downtime associated with these ALA-PDT treatments. CONCLUSIONS: HS is a chronic disease which most dermatologists find difficult to treat. The use of ALA-PDT is finding an ever-expanding role in dermatology. These case studies support the use of ALA-PDT in cases of HS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is increasing in dermatology. Antibiotic resistance and the challenges of isotretinoin therapy have led to investigation of PDT in the treatment of acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVE: To review the results of clinical trials and case series with respect to light source, topical photosensitizing agent, adverse events, efficacy and skin type. METHODS: A non-critical review is presented of a PubMed search for studies examining PDT in the treatment of acne vulgaris. RESULTS: The authors found 21 clinical trials and case series of various designs. Eight studies employed a split-face design comparing photosensitizer to placebo, no treatment or another photosensitizer. Two trials used three test spots and one control spot per patient. Three studies utilized control subjects receiving no photosensitizer with or without light therapy. All 21 studies reported a reduction in inflammatory lesions and/or a significant improvement in acne. The light sources utilized included blue light, pulsed-dye laser (PDL), intense pulsed light (IPL) and red light. Studies comparing the use of PDT to light therapy alone demonstrated greater improvement in treatment groups pretreated with a photosensitizer. CONCLUSION: All studies reported reduction in inflammatory lesions or significant improvement in acne. Several studies confirm a light source combined with photosensitizer is superior to light alone. Adverse reactions including photosensitivity, pustular eruptions, and crusting varied among photosensitizers and light sources. PDT appears to be a useful therapeutic option for acne patients who are recalcitrant to standard treatments and poor candidates for systemic retinoids. Further studies are still needed before a consensus protocol can be established. Additional investigations are needed to establish optimal incubation time, activating light source and frequency of treatment.

AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) takes advantage of our understanding of the cutaneous response to topically applied porphyrins to selectively destroy malignant or premalignant cells. This type of therapy has been used to treat a variety of cutaneous diseases, including actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, acne, and others. The treatment protocols are not standardized across institutions. We present the Henry Ford Dermatology protocol and early results of our first 150 treatments with PDT.

AB  - The successful treatment of acne still remains problematic. Conventional therapies often prove inconsistent with unacceptable side effects and recurrence rates, leading to patient noncompliance. A thermal phototherapy treatment using a combination of blue light and red light has recently attracted much attention and seems to offer an effective alternative. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of blue light (415 nm) in combination with red light (633 nm) in the reduction of inflammatory lesions on the face of subjects (n=21) with mild to moderate acne vulgaris after a course of 8 20-minute (blue) or 30-minute (red) alternated light treatments, self-administered by a handheld unit over a period of 4 weeks. Lesion counts progressively reduced throughout the 4-week light therapy period and continued to reduce up to 8 weeks posttherapy, with a final average reduction of 69% seen 8 weeks after the treatment course (P>.001). This pattern is similar to previously reported studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current standard of care for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) includes antibiotics (oral/topical), retinoids (oral/topical) and intralesional steroids and is unsatisfactory. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 20% 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has been used ?off label? to treat acne vulgaris and may hold promise as a therapy for HS. This open-label, non-blinded study investigated the efficacy and safety of ALA PDT for the treatment of HS using two blue light sources and intense pulsed light (IPL) for photoactivation. METHODS: Twelve subjects with active HS enrolled to undergo ALA PDT once weekly for four weeks with follow-up visits 4, 8, and 12 or more weeks later. Nine subjects completed the study through the week 8 follow-up visit. Lesions were counted at each treatment visit at week 4, week 8 and at the final week. RESULTS: Mean lesion counts were 11.25 at baseline, 6.5 at 4 weeks (50.8% reduction), and 7.5 at 8 weeks (29.9% reduction). Mean Global Severity Scores were 2.2 at baseline, 1.5 at 4 weeks, and 1.8 at 8 weeks. Mean DLQI scores were 17.3 at baseline, 13.1 at 4 weeks (27.2% improvement), 14.00 at 8 weeks (19.3% improvement) and 14.0 (19.3% improvement) at the final week (16-62 weeks). Three subjects (25%) had complete clearance and no active lesions 4 weeks after the final treatment. Treatments were more tolerable for subjects treated with blue light than with IPL. CONCLUSION: ALA PDT may be a safe and effective treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment of acne vulgaris with light sources necessitates multiple targets including Propionibacterium acnes and sebaceous glands. Traditional light sources such as blue light capitalize on P acnes bacteria as targets while infrared lasers and radiofrequency devices target the sebaceous gland. A novel device combining vacuum and a unique broadband light source was designed to combine multiple targets for the effective treatment of acne. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a novel device that uses a combination of broadband light and pneumatic energy for the treatment of acne vulgaris. METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study, clinical data were collected from 56 patients with mild to severe acne. Patients had been treated 2 to 4 times with a portable photopneumatic device (Aesthera PPx, Aesthera Corporation, Pleasanton, CA) that delivers broadband light (400 to 1200 nm) to the treatment site via a hand piece. For 11 of the 56 patients, 3 independent physicians blinded to the study treatment or duration evaluated PPx efficacy by comparing photographs taken before and after PPx treatment. RESULTS: For the 56 patients, the median physician-rated clearance increased from 50% after a single treatment to 90% after the fourth treatment, whereas the median patient-rated clearance improved from 50% after a single treatment to 78% after the fourth treatment. On a 4-point scale, both physician-rated and patient-rated median overall satisfaction levels increased from a 3 after a single treatment, to 4 after the second, third, and fourth treatments. Clinically significant adverse events were not observed. For the 11 patients evaluated by photography, the median papule and pustule lesion counts decreased from 8 to 3 and from 2 to 0, respectively. Median acne severity (Burton scale) decreased from 4 before treatment to 2 after the final treatment, and the median improvement was 4.5 (scale 1-5). The median erythema rating decreased from 2 before treatment to 1 after the final treatment (scale 1-4). Adverse events were limited to mild erythema. The median acne clearance was 3 (scale 1-4). CONCLUSION: Photopneumatic technology provides a safe and effective treatment of mild to severe acne vulgaris.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Narrow-band blue light (420 nm) has demonstrated safety and efficacy in the treatment of acne vulgaris. It works by exhibiting a phototoxic effect on the heme metabolism of Propionibacterium acnes. Previous studies using blue light showed more improvement in inflammatory lesions than in comedones, as well as some improvement on the untreated side. Cytokines have demonstrated a critical role in the development of inflammation. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1alpha have been shown to result in the expression of vascular and dermal adhesion molecules, the chemoattraction of inflammatory cells, and the stimulation of other inflammatory mediators. In addition, UVB radiation serves as a potent modulator of cell-mediated immune responses. PURPOSE: This study investigated the effect of narrow-band blue light on the inflammatory process in the presence and absence of cytokines and UVB using IL-1alpha and ICAM-1 as markers for inflammation. METHODS: Two immortalized keratinocyte cell lines were compared: HaCaT, produced by spontaneous immortalization of a genetically altered cell line, and hTERT, obtained by stable transfection of primary cell culture with human telomerase reverse transcriptase. Cells were treated with INF-y and TNF-alpha and exposed to UVB (312 nm at 50 mJ/cm2) and/or blue light (420 nm at 54 mJ/cm2 and 134 mJ/cm2). The expression of IL-1alpha and ICAM-1 was measured by quantitative ELISA. RESULTS: The results showed that blue light and low-dose UVB treatment of HaCaT and hTERT cells resulted in inhibition of cytokine-induced production of IL-1alpha. The level of IL-1alpha decreased by 82% in HaCaT and by 75% in hTERT cells when exposed to blue light. It decreased by 95% in HaCaT and by 91% in hTERT cells when blue light was used in combination with UVB. ICAM-1 expression was similarly reduced in HaCaT, but not in hTERT cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that narrow-band blue light has anti-inflammatory effects on keratinocytes by decreasing the cytokine-induced production of IL-1alpha and ICAM-1. In addition, blue light demonstrated synergistic effects with low-dose UVB light. These results expand the properties of narrow-band blue light in modulating the inflammatory process and will facilitate testing of its phototherapeutic applications in different inflammatory skin conditions.

AB  - <p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a topical photosensitizing agent which is activated by a light source to cause destruction of specific cells. Commonly used for the treatment of actinic keratoses and photodamage, PDT can also be used for other conditions including acne and sebaceous hyperplasia. Here we report our experience with two treatment protocols. The first protocol utilizes laser assisted delivery of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid for enhanced efficacy of blue light photodynamic therapy in the treatment of actinic keratoses and photodamage. The second protocol utilizes red light photodynamic therapy followed by pulsed dye laser to effectively target sebaceous glands in patients with extensive sebaceous hyperplasia.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(4):329-331.</em></p>.

AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with use of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA, Levulan Kerastick, Dusa Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Wilmington, MA) photosensitizing agent is a new modality for the treatment of acne. Eighteen patients (aged 15 to 63) with moderate to severe inflammatory acne received ALA-PDT. ALA remained in contact with skin for 15 to 30 minutes before exposure to blue light (ClearLight [Lumenis] or BLU-U [Dusa Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]) or the Aurora DSR (Syneron Medical Ltd.), which uses Electro-Optical Synergy (ELOS), a unique combination of optical and radiofrequency (RF) energy. Patients received two to four ALA-PDT treatments over four to eight weeks or two cycles of ALA-PDT (weeks 2, 4) preceded by salicylic acid peel (weeks 1, 3) over four weeks. The average follow-up time was four months. On a scale of 0.0 to 4.0, the average acne grade improvement was 1.75. Among the 12 patients who said their acne had improved, 11 had at least 50% improvement and five had more than 75% improvement. Adverse effects were limited to erythema and peeling for up to five days after treatment and one episode of impetiginization of the affected area. Patients with moderate to severe acne can achieve durable improvement with short-contact ALA-PDT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is an emerging modality for the treatment of acne vulgaris. However, optimal therapeutic protocols have not been established. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacies of 3 different light sources for activating ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX for the treatment of acne vulgaris. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with moderate to severe acne vulgaris were randomly assigned to receive ALA-PDT with photoactivation by intense pulsed light (IPL, 600-850 nm), a combination of IPL (580-980 nm) and bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies, or blue light (417 nm). Each patient received 3 ALA-PDT sessions at 2-week intervals. Follow-up evaluations were conducted 1 and 3 months after the final treatment. RESULTS: At 1 month and 3 months, median lesion count reduction percentages were highest with IPL activation and lowest with blue light activation, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. At 1 month and 3 months, median investigator-assessed improvements were highest with IPL activation and lowest with blue light activation. The variability of responses was significantly smaller with IPL activation than with either RF-IPL or blue light activation. CONCLUSION: ALA-PDT with activation by IPL appears to provide greater, longer-lasting, and more consistent improvement than either RF-IPL or blue light activation in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies indicate photodynamic therapy is an effective treatment of inflammatory acne lesions on patients with Fitzpatrick skin types 1-3. There is a lack of evidence in the literature regarding the use of photodynamic therapy to treat acne vulgaris in African American patients. This article reports the first case of blue light photodynamic therapy to treat moderate inflammatory facial acne on an African American patient with type 5 skin. OBSERVATIONS: This article describes a 26-year-old African American woman with moderate inflammatory facial acne vulgaris. On examination, she had over 15 inflammatory papules on her face and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The patient had a history of treatment failure with the following therapies: topical benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics, topical retinoids and oral antibiotics. At presentation, the patient was using a combination topical benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin product in the morning and tazoratene gel in the evening without success. The patient was treated with 20% aminolevulinic acid/blue-light photodynamic therapy spaced monthly for a total of four treatments, a once-daily application of hydroquinone 4% cream and her existing topical regimen. The patient reported significant improvement of inflammatory acne lesions and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation following two treatments with photodynamic therapy and was virtually clear of all acne lesions after the third treatment. CONCLUSION: Photodynamic therapy is an emerging remedy for patients with acne vulgaris resistant to standard treatment, particularly in patients with skin of color who are more sensitive to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. In this African-American patient, 20% aminolevulinic acid/blue-light photodynamic therapy was effective in treating facial acne vulgaris.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of treating mild-to-moderate facial acne using a new, hand-held, light-emitting diode blue light device in conjunction with a foam cleanser containing 5% glycolic acid and 2% salicylic acid plus a skin rebuilding serum containing 1.25% salicylic acid, 0.5% niacinamide, 0.08% liposomal-based azelaic acid and superoxide dismutase. METHODS: Volunteers with mild-to-moderate facial inflammatory acne used the blue light device twice daily for eight weeks, plus the cleanser before treatments and the serum after each evening treatment. RESULTS: Among 33 subjects aged 25-45 years old, 28 completed. In a 3 cm x 5 cm target area receiving a daily dose of ~29 J/cm2, treatment was associated with significant reductions from baseline in the inflammatory lesion count from week 1 onward (P≤ .01) and in the non-inflammatory lesion count from week 4 onward (P≤ .05). The number of flares was significantly reduced from baseline from week 2 onward (P≤ .05), and flare severity and flare redness were significantly reduced from baseline from week 4 onward (P≤ .01 and P≤ .05, respectively). At week 8, more than 90 percent of subjects reported improvements in their skin's overall appearance, clarity, radiance, tone, texture and smoothness. In addition, 82 percent were satisfied, very satisfied, or extremely satisfied with the blue light treatment system and 86 percent agreed the treatment system was much gentler than traditional acne treatments. CONCLUSION: The blue light treatment system offers effective, rapid, convenient and well tolerated treatment of inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions. The majority of subjects consider it much gentler than traditional acne treatments and it facilitates effective treatment without the need for antibiotic exposure. The blue light treatment system and blue light therapy alone are attractive treatment options for acne vulgaris, both as alternatives to traditional acne treatments and as adjunctive treatments to complement existing therapies.

AB  - Modern acne therapy uses anticomedogenic, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory,and antiandrogenic substances. As an additional approach in recent years, treatments have been developed based on the application of electromagnetic radiation. Visible light or infrared wave lengths are utilized by most techniques, including blue light lamps, intense pulsed light, photodynamic therapy and lasers. This review evaluates the various methods with regard to efficacy and their current role in the management of acne. Although UV radiation has been frequently used to treat acne, it is now regarded as obsolete due to the unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. Visible light, especially of blue wavelengths, appears to be suitable for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne. Photodynamic therapy is effective, but, due to considerable immediate side effects, it is best reserved for selected situations. Despite promising observations, intense pulsed light and lasers have to be evaluated in further studies, before they can be recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blue light in the 400-420 nm range has been shown to reduce the levels of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) in the skin. P. acnes has been postulated to be a critical trigger for inflammatory acne. Thus, treatment with 420 nm-intense pulsed light should reduce inflammatory activity in acne. AIM: To evaluate the clinical and histological effects of 420 nm-intense pulsed light treatment on acne in animal model. METHOD: Inflammation acne animal model was constructed by intradermal injection of P. acnes of rat auricular. Levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), markers of inflammation implicated in acne, were assessed in treated and untreated animals by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULT: Treatment with 420 nm intense pulsed light led to marked improvement after 6 biweekly treatments. Immunohistochemistry and PCR showed that TNF-α and MMP-2 levels correlated with the extent of acneiform activity and were reduced by treatment with 420 nm light. CONCLUSION: A 420-nm intense pulsed light may exert its beneficial effects on inflammatory acne by reducing the levels of P. acnes and secondarily reducing inflammation induced by the bacteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to elucidate why some potentially damaging and beneficial effects were obtained following blue light exposures on skin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Light-emitting diode (LED) devices containing 415 and 470 nm bulbs were used on normal human keratinocytes, skin biopsies and subjects with acne. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) evaluation was performed after a course of blue LED light exposures. A comparison between very small bandwidth centered at 415 nm and a combination of (415 + 470 nm) wavelengths was also carried out regarding the effects on ROS production. The effects on other targets such as opsin1 short wavelength (OPN1 SW) photoreceptor, fibrillin-1 dermal component, LL37 antimicrobial peptide and interleukin-8 (IL-8) proinflammatory cytokine were then explored. Finally, clinical pictures of acne signs were also investigated after blue LED exposures. RESULTS: Dose dependent increases of ROS production were obtained on keratinocytes exposed to increasing 415 nm LED exposures. However, a ROS decreasing first phase was observed on keratinocytes exposed to 415 + 470 nm LED exposures. Moreover, comparing the same doses of 415 nm wavelength and (415 + 470 nm) wavelength combination, 415 nm alone is more damaging than the 415 + 470 nm exposures. In case of increase in ROS, decrease in OPN1 SW photoreceptor and fragmentation of fibrillin-1 dermal fiber were observed. When conditions of ROS decrease were experienced, an increase in LL37 antimicrobial peptide and a modulation of IL-8 inflammatory response were noted, suggesting improvement in acne signs. Clinical results confirmed the benefits on inflammatory lesions on subjects with acne. CONCLUSION: Blue lights can induce beneficial and adverse effects, depending on the dose and on the spectrum width of the exposure.

AB  - Propionibacterium acnes infection is the eighth most prevalent disease, affecting 80% of people worldwide. Resistance to antibiotics has been on the rise; over 40% of acne infections now resist commonly used topical and oral anti-acnes antibiotics, making treatment difficult. In our effort to refine blue light as an alternative safe clinically effective treatment, we determined if 100% bacterial suppression is attainable at ultralow irradiances and radiant energies, and explored the relationship between bacterial suppression and fluorescence during treatment. P. acnes were irradiated in vitro repeatedly three times per day at 3- or 4-hour intervals over three or more days, using 3 or 5 J/cm(2) radiant energy of 450 nm pulsed blue light (PBL) at irradiances as low as 2 mW/cm(2). In another series of experiments, we measured changes in P. acnes fluorescence as bacteria were repeatedly irradiated at various radiant exposures over three to four days. Our results showed that (1) 33% PBL, applied three times per day at 3-hour intervals each day over a three-day period at 2 mW/cm(2) irradiance and 5 J/cm(2) radiant exposure, resulted in100% bacterial suppression (7 log(10) reduction), (2) the absorbed 450 nm light caused P. acnes to fluoresce predominantly in the red spectrum, with the fluorescence diminishing correlatively as treatment was repeated at 3-hour intervals and rising significantly during long periods of no treatment, and (3) treatment at 3-hour intervals gave better results than treatment at 4-hour intervals.

AB  - Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) is an opportunistic infection in human skin that causes acne vulgaris. Antibiotic agents provide the effective eradication of microbes until the development of drug-resistant microbes. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a non-antibiotic therapy for microbial eradication. In this study, the visible blue light (BL, λ(max) = 462 nm) was used to enhance the antimicrobial activities of curcumin, a natural phenolic compound. Individual exposure to curcumin or BL irradiation does not generate cytotoxicity on P. acnes. The viability of P. acnes was decreased significantly in 0.09 J/cm(2) BL with 1.52 μM of curcumin. Furthermore, the low-dose blue light irradiation triggers a series of cytotoxic actions of curcumin on P. acnes. The lethal factors of photolytic curcumin were investigated based on the morphology of P. acnes by SEM and fluorescent images. The membrane disruption of microbes was observed on the PDI against P. acnes. Chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques were also used to identify the photolytic metabolites. Curcumin could be photolysed into vanillin through BL irradiation, which presents a strong linear relationship in quantitation. Because the safety of blue light in mammalian cell has been proven, the photolytic curcumin treatment could support non-antibiotic therapy to eradicate P. acnes on clinical dermatology.

AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a medical procedure that involves incubation of an exogenously applied photosensitizer (PS) followed by visible light photoactivation to induce cell apoptosis. The Federal Drug Administration has approved PDT for the treatment of actinic keratosis, and clinical guidelines recommend PDT as a treatment for certain non-melanoma skin cancers and acne vulgaris. PDT is an advantageous therapeutic modality as it is low cost, non-invasive, and associated with minimal adverse events and scaring. In the first step of PDT, a PS is applied and allowed to accumulate intracellularly. Subsequent light irradiation induces reactive oxygen species formation, which may ultimately lead to cell apoptosis, membrane disruption, mitochondrial damage, immune modulation, keratinocyte proliferation, and collagen turnover. Herein, we present an in vitro method to study PDT in an adherent cell line. This treatment protocol is designed to simulate PDT and may be adjusted to studying the use of PDT with various cell lines, photosensitizers, incubation temperatures, or photoactivation wavelengths. Squamous cell carcinoma cells were incubated with 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2 mM 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) for 30 min and photoactivated with 417 nm blue light for 1,000 s. The primary outcome measure was apoptosis and necrosis, as measured by annexin-V and 7-aminoactinomycin D flow cytometry. There was a dose-dependent increase in cell apoptosis following thirty-minute incubation of 5-ALA. To achieve high inter-test validity, it is important to maintain consistent incubation and light parameters when performing in vitro PDT experiments. PDT is a useful clinical procedure and in vitro research may allow for the development of novel PSs, optimization of protocols, and new indications for PDT.

AB  - A healthy female genital mucosa has an ecosystem that remains in balance through interactions between endogenous and exogenous factors. The light-emitting diode (LED) is a device that emits light at different wavelengths, with varying color and effects. Blue light in humans is most commonly used for antimicrobial purposes and has been already applied to treat facial acne and gastric bacteria. Although blue LED therapy in humans has been reported, its properties against vaginal infections have not yet been investigated. This study aims to test the safety and effects of 401 ± 5 nm blue LED on healthy vaginal mucosa. Phase I clinical trial involving 10 women between 18 and 45 years old with healthy vaginal mucosa. The participants were illuminated by 401 ± 5 nm blue LED for 30 min and anamnesis, oncotic cytology, and pH measurement were made again after 21/28 days of treatment. In the re-evaluation, adverse effects were investigated. The mean age was 27 ± 5.4 years and one of the women was excluded due to interruption of use of oral contraceptives. Oncotic cytology done before and after therapy showed that the composition of the microflora remained normal in all participants. Vaginal pH remained unchanged in eight of the women and had a reduction in one woman (5.0-4.0). No adverse effects were observed during or after illumination. 401 ± 5 nm blue LED did not generate any adverse effects or pathogenic changes in the microflora and vaginal pH. The effects of 401 ± 5 nm blue LED still need to be tested in vulvovaginal pathogens. Trial registration number: NCT03075046.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent advances in low-level light devices have opened new treatment options for mild to moderate acne patients. Light therapies have been used to treat a variety of skin conditions over the years but were typically only available as treatments provided by professional clinicians. Clinical application of blue light has proven to be effective for a broader spectral range and at lower fluences than previously utilized. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that sub-milliwatt/cm(2) levels of long-wave blue light (449 nm) effectively kills Propionibacterium acnes, a causative agent of acne vulgaris, in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two types of LED light boards were designed to facilitate in vitro blue light irradiation to either six-well plates containing fluid culture or a petri plate containing solid medium. P. acnes. Survival was determined by counting colony forming units (CFU) following irradiation. P. acnes was exposed in the presence and absence of oxygen. Coproporphyrin III (CPIII) photoexcitation was spectrophotometrically evaluated at 415 and 440 nm to compare the relative photochemical activities of these wavelengths. RESULTS: 422 and 449 nm blue light killed P. acnes in planktonic culture. Irradiation with 449 nm light also effectively killed P. acnes on a solid agar surface. Variation of time or intensity of light exposure resulted in a fluence-dependent improvement of antimicrobial activity. The presence of oxygen was necessary for killing of P. acnes with 449 nm light. CPIII displayed clear photoexcitation at both 415 and 440 nm, indicating that both wavelengths are capable of initiating CPIII photoexcitation at low incident light intensities (50 uW/cm(2) ). CONCLUSION: Herein we demonstrate that sub-milliwatt/cm(2) levels of long-wave blue light (449 nm) effectively kill P. acnes. The methods and results presented allow for deeper exploration and design of light therapy treatments. Results from these studies are expanding our understanding of the mode of action and functionality of blue light, allowing for improved options for acne patients. Lasers Surg.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was discovered over 100 years ago by its ability to kill various microorganisms when the appropriate dye and light were combined in the presence of oxygen. However it is only in relatively recent times that PDT has been studied as a treatment for various types of localized infections. This resurgence of interest has been partly motivated by the alarming increase in drug resistance amongst bacteria and other pathogens. This review will focus on the clinical applications of antimicrobial PDT. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: The published peer-reviewed literature was reviewed between 1960 and 2011. RESULTS: The basics of antimicrobial PDT are discussed. Clinical applications of antimicrobial PDT to localized viral infections caused by herpes and papilloma viruses, and nonviral dermatological infections such as acne and other yeast, fungal and bacterial skin infections are covered. PDT has been used to treat bacterial infections in brain abscesses and non-healing ulcers. PDT for dental infections including periodontitis and endodontics has been well studied. PDT has also been used for cutaneous Leishmaniasis. Clinical trials of PDT and blue light alone therapy for gastric Helicobacter pylori infection are also covered. CONCLUSION: As yet clinical PDT for infections has been mainly in the field of dermatology using 5-aminolevulanic acid and in dentistry using phenothiazinium dyes. We expect more to see applications of PDT to more challenging infections using advanced antimicrobial photosensitizers targeted to microbial cells in the years to come.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Blue light is effective for acne treatment, inducing photodynamic destruction of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of combined blue and red light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy for acne vulgaris. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with mild to moderately severe facial acne were treated with quasimonochromatic LED devices, alternating blue (415 nm) and red (633 nm) light. The treatment was performed twice a week for 4 weeks. Objective assays of the skin condition were carried out before and after treatment at each treatment session. Clinical assessments were conducted before treatment, after the 2nd, 4th, and 6th treatment sessions and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the final treatment by grading and lesion counting. RESULTS: The final mean percentage improvements in non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions were 34.28% and 77.93%, respectively. Instrumental measurements indicated that the melanin levels significantly decreased after treatment. Brightened skin tone and improved skin texture were spontaneously reported by 14 patients. CONCLUSION: Blue and red light combination LED phototherapy is an effective, safe and non-painful treatment for mild to moderately severe acne vulgaris, particularly for papulopustular acne lesions.

AB  - Phototherapy is an important method of dermatological treatments. Ultraviolet (280-400 nm) therapy is of great importance; however, there are concerns of its long-term use, as it can lead to skin aging and carcinogenesis. This review aims to evaluate the role and the mechanism of action of blue light (400-500 nm), a UV-free method. The main mediators of cellular responses to blue light are nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the detailed mechanism is still not fully understood. It was demonstrated that blue light induces an anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effect; thus, it may be beneficial for hyperproliferative and chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis. It was also found that blue light might cause the reduction of itching. It may be beneficial on hair growth and may be used in the treatment of acne vulgaris by reducing follicular colonization of Propionibacterium acnes. Further studies are needed to develop accurate protocols, as the clinical effects depend on the light parameters as well as the treatment length. There are no major adverse effects observed yet, but long-term safety should be monitored as there are no studies considering the long-term effects of blue light on the skin.

AB  - Blue light irradiation (BLI) is an FDA-approved method for treating certain types of infections, like acne, and is becoming increasingly attractive as an antimicrobial strategy as the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant "superbugs" rises. However, no study has delineated the effectiveness of BLI throughout different bacterial growth phases, especially in more BLI-tolerant organisms such as Escherichia coli. While the vast majority of E. coli strains are nonpathogenic, several E. coli pathotypes exist that cause infection within and outside the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we compared the response of E. coli strains from five phylogenetic groups to BLI with a 455 nm wavelength (BLI(455) ), using colony-forming unit and ATP measurement assays. Our results revealed that BLI(455) is not bactericidal, but can retard E. coli growth in a manner that is dependent on culture age and strain background. This observation is critical, given that bacteria on and within mammalian hosts are found in different phases of growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is based on the principle of using light excitation of a wavelength-specific endogenous or exogenous photosensitizer to destroy the target tissue, and has shown efficacy in the treatment of certain non-melanoma skin cancers. PDT using aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) has attracted attention in the treatment of acne vulgaris. METHOD: Twenty patients with moderate to severe acne vulgaris on the face were treated with four sessions of topical ALA-PDT with blue light (415 nm) on the right side of the face compared with blue light alone on the left side of the face, each treatment being 1 week apart. Ten percent of topical ALA was applied to acne spots on the right side of the face with a 1-h incubation period and the entire face was treated with 48 J/cm(2) of 415 +/- 5 nm light from an articulated LED planar array. Evaluation was performed by counting acne lesions at baseline, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after the beginning of the treatment. Biophysical measurements included sebum levels and the erythema, and melanin indices. RESULT: At the given assessment times 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after the beginning of the treatment, the mean percent reduction in inflamed lesions counts tended to be higher in the ALA-PDT areas; it was 32%, 50.9%, 65.9% and 71.1%, respectively, compared with the blue-light-alone treatment, which was 20.7%, 27%, 57.7% and 56.7%, respectively, but without any statistical significance (P=0.092). There was no demonstrable significant change in sebum excretion, erythema or the melanin index after treatment. The side effects were pain, stinging, peeling, erythema, pruritus, oozing and pustules. These side effects were stronger on the ALA-PDT-treated side. CONCLUSION: From this study, the trend for ALA-PDT with blue light to be superior to blue light alone was observed, but it did not reach statistical significance. ALA-PDT had more side effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Red and blue light therapies are safe and effective treatments for mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris. However, very few previous studies have directly compared the characteristics of these two methods. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of red light (RL) and blue light (BL) for acne vulgaris and to assess these two therapies in different types of lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 28 subjects with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris were randomized into the RL group or the BL group. Subjects in each group received different light treatments, and they were followed up regularly until 2 weeks after the last treatment. The improvement rates of different types of acne lesions were compared between the 2 groups, as well as the incidence of adverse reactions. RESULTS: At the 2-week follow-up, the average improvement rate of total acne lesions was 36.2% in the RL group and 30.7% in the BL group (p > .05). The average improvement rate of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions was 51.5% and 17.3% in the RL group, compared with 26.4% and 10.0% in the BL group (all p > .05). Treatment-related adverse reactions were observed distinctly in the BL group. CONCLUSIONS: Red light and BL therapies have similar efficacy in mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris, especially for inflammatory lesions. RL had advantages with fewer adverse reactions compared with BL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of blue light phototherapy on inflammatory acne lesions were recently investigated. Many reports have used high-intensity, narrow-band 420 nm UV-free blue light delivery systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate a new blue light system (MultiClear) for targeted blue light phototherapy. METHOD: Ten Japanese patients with acne on the face or back were treated with targeted blue light once or twice a week. Acne severity was graded according to the acne severity score suggested by Allen and Smith (1982). If the acne was prevalent on the back or chest, the acne severity score of Burton et al. (1971) was adopted. The new targeting blue light system is equipped with a flexible optical light guide as a delivery system and the treatment device is placed directly only on the affected area. RESULT: Of the 10 patients, eight had a significantly reduced acne severity score without any side effects. Although two patients discontinued the study because of unsatisfactory results, none of the patients showed any harmful side effects from the targeted blue light phototherapy. CONCLUSION: Targeted blue light phototherapy with MultiClear is effective for the treatment of inflammatory acne lesions. This new irradiation device offers some advantages over previous blue light systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blue light irradiation is known to be effective against acne. However, the profile of a good candidate is still unclear. METHODS: Thirty-one Taiwanese with symmetrical facial acne were irradiated with blue light on one side of the face selected randomly twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. The other half of the face was left untreated as control. Parameters, including scar type, pore size, and facial follicular porphyrin fluorescence intensity, were documented. The severity of acne was assessed before the treatment, after two, four, and eight sessions of treatment, and 1 month after the treatment was completed. RESULTS: Compared with the non-irradiation side, eight sessions of blue light irradiation were effective in acne treatment (P<0.001). Gender (P=0.471), scar type (P-values of pitted, atrophic, and hypertrophic type were 0.688, 0.572, and 0.802, respectively), pore size (P=0.755), and pretreatment fluorescence intensity (P=0.656) could not be used as predictive factors of therapeutic effectiveness. Compared with pretreatment, nodulocystic lesions tended to worsen despite treatment. In addition, the therapeutic effectiveness was not related to the fluorescence intensity change (P=0.812). CONCLUSIONS: Blue light irradiation is effective in acne treatment. Patients without nodulocystic lesions are better candidates for blue light irradiation.

AB  - Acne is a very prevalent skin disorder, affecting more than 85% of adolescents and often continuing into adulthood. Active acne and its sequelae, especially permanent scarring, may cause longstanding psychological or emotional harm in patients. Novel and promising treatments with laser/light devices (such as blue light, red light, pulsed dye laser, infrared lasers, light-emitting diodes, and pulsed light) have been reported to have varying degrees of efficacy for treatment. The authors compiled a summary of evidence-based literature on laser/light treatment for acne to assist clinicians to more appropriately identify treatment options, should they choose to supplement current medical antiacne therapies.

AB  - Acne is a dermatosis that affects almost 90% of the adolescent population worldwide and its treatment is performed with retinoids, antimicrobials, acids, and topical or systemic antibiotics. Side effects such as skin irritation in addition to microbial resistance to antibiotics are the main side effects found. Phototherapy with blue light is being used as an alternative treatment. Our objective was to analyze the use of blue light to treat inflammatory acne. We conducted a systematic literature review, following the recommendation PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses), including in the sample randomized clinical trial studies that compared blue light with another intervention as control. The research was carried out in the PUBMED and WEB of SCIENCE databases and the methodological quality of the studies evaluated were made by the Cochrane Collaboration Bias Risk Scale. After the exclusion of duplicates, the titles and abstracts of 81 articles were evaluated, and 50 articles were selected for full reading, including in the review at the end 8 articles. Studies have shown significant improvements in the overall picture of acne. It is concluded that despite the great potential in its use in the treatment of acne, there is a need for more detailed trials on the effect of blue light on the treatment of inflammatory acne.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Computational skin analysis is revolutionizing modern dermatology. Patterns extracted from image sequences enable algorithmic evaluation. Stacking multiple images to analyze pattern variation implicitly assumes that the images are aligned per-pixel. However, breathing and involuntary motion of the patient causes significant misalignment. Alignment algorithms designed for multimodal and time-lapse skin images can solve this problem. Sequences from multi-modal imaging capture unique appearance features in each modality. Time-lapse image sequences capture skin appearance change over time. METHODS: Multimodal skin images have been acquired under five different modalities: three in reflectance (visible, parallel-polarized, and cross-polarized) and two in fluorescence mode (UVA and blue light excitation). For time-lapse imagery, 39 images of acne lesions over a 3-month period have been collected. The method detects micro-level features like pores, wrinkles, and other skin texture markings in the acquired images. Images are automatically registered to subpixel accuracy. RESULTS: The proposed registration approach precisely aligns multimodal and time-lapse images. Subsurface recovery from multimodal images has misregistration artefacts that can be eliminated using this approach. Registered time-lapse imaging captures the evolution of appearance of skin regions with time. CONCLUSION: Misalignment in skin imaging has significant impact on any quantitative or qualitative image evaluation. Micro-level features can be used to obtain highly accurate registration. Multimodal images can be organized with maximal overlap for successful registration. The resulting point-to-point alignment improves the quality of skin image analysis.

AB  - Reports of the sequential use of multiple light and laser sources for topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) activation in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of inflammatory acne vulgaris are lacking. The authors sought to retrospectively compare field-directed ALA-PDT with blue light only, blue light + pulsed dye laser (PDL), blue light + intense pulsed light (IPL), blue light + PDL + IPL, or blue light + red light + PDL + IPL for inflammatory acne of the face or upper trunk. Results showed a trend toward greater patient-reported improvement with comparable tolerability using multiple, sequential light sources in ALA-PDT for acne vulgaris, albeit not statistically significant. The addition of red light, however, did not improve outcomes. The disparate numbers of patients between treatment arms and high potential for recall bias limit this single-center retrospective study.

AB  - The bacterium Propionibacterium acnes is light-sensitive due to porphyrin-induced photosensitization. The light sensitivity increases with incubation of 5-aminolevulinic acid, ALA. For the first time, 1H magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy is used to describe the photoinduced changes in the bacterium after ALA incubation. Successful photosensitization was performed with light-emitting diodes in the blue and red regions (430 and 654 nm, respectively). The irradiation setup, suitable for irradiation of bacterium suspensions in petri dishes is described. For NMR studies blue light diodes with about 90 micromol/m2s were chosen. After blue light irradiation, the endogenous glycine betaine, proline, glutamate and choline levels in P. acnes decreased with increasing irradiation time. For sublethal light doses (50% survival fraction), the endogenous glycine betaine level decreased 80% on average. The corresponding percentages for proline, choline and glutamate were about 40, 25 and 10, respectively. It is hypothesized that the irradiation, inducing porphyrin photosensitization amplified by ALA incubation, leads to elimination of the osmolyte glycine betaine and possibly also proline by so-called regulatory volume decrease (RVD) mechanisms. These mechanisms are known to be active in several prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells when exposed to hypotonic stress. They are also known to be present in several eukaryotic cells during photodynamic therapy (PDT) exposure leading to hypotonoc stress. The findings contribute to the knowledge of the inactivation mechanisms of P. acnes in photosensitization, and could therefore be of interest in the efforts to use PDT as treatment of the acne disease.
